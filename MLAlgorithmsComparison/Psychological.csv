The results suggest a significant impact of weather variables - temperature and rainfall, and their shocks on agricultural productivity in Tanzania. Also, farmers' education appears to reduce the impact of temperature shocks on productivity. These findings imply a need for policy intervention to ensure that farmers are equipped for climate change adaptation as well as the use of modern farming technologies and inputs.","2022-01-02","2023-09-26 16:12:45","2023-09-26 16:12:45","","129-145","","1","36","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000728473500001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;60</p>","","","ADAPTATION; AFRICA; Agriculture; climate change; CROP YIELDS; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; FLUCTUATIONS; OLS; RAINFALL; Tanzania; TEMPERATURE; TRENDS; VARIABILITY; yield; YIELD RESPONSE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Tungabhadra basin, located in peninsular India, has a variety of challenges, including inter-basin water-sharing issues, low agricultural productivity and value, and rising need for renewable energy production. The Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) water yield model is used to analyze the consequences of climate change on water related services such as water yield and hydropower generation in the densely populated Tungabhadra basin. The impact of climate change on water supply services is studied for the period 1971-2000 as well as the future period 2021-2040. The model is calibrated using streamflow data collected at the Bawapuram gauge station in Telangana and there is a strong correlation between observed and simulated flow. The water yield for the entire basin declined by 33 and 50% under the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, respectively. The RCP 4.5 scenario reduces hydropower production and its Net Present Value (NPV) by 41 to 59%, whereas the RCP 8.5 scenario reduces production and NPV by 56 to 67%. The assessment of ecosystem services at the catchment scale revealed that the basin could be vulnerable to climate change due to a dramatic drop in ecosystem services. The methodology developed in this study can be applied to other river basins where quantifying ecosystem services is critical.","2022-01","2023-09-26 16:12:45","2023-09-26 16:12:45","","94-106","","1","38","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000715487600001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;9<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;9<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;68</p>","","","climate change; RAINFALL; BALANCE MODEL; CLASSIFICATION; DATA SET; ecosystem services; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; FOOD-ENERGY NEXUS; hydrology; hydropower; INDIA; RIVER-BASIN; SOIL","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A shoreline evolution model including cross-shore and alongshore sediment transport formulations, short- and long-term processes and hard structure treatment is developed. The historical analysis of the shoreline evolution is performed by forcing the model with waves and storm surges from reanalysis data, and with tides from in situ water level measurements. The model is calibrated and validated by using morphological information derived from the KostaSystem coastal video monitoring system. The analysis of the future impact of climate change on the sandy beaches is carried out using two sea level projections (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios) and their confidence intervals, combined with synthetic wave series that allowed a probabilistic fashion outcome. The results show that the shoreline mean erosion due to both short- and long-term processes is in the range of 10-45 m under the RCP 4.5 scenario and 14-66 m under RCP 8.5 by the year 2100, which indicate the great vulnerability of the beaches of the Basque Coast. Still, the response of the studied systems is highly variable, owing to the intrinsic characteristic of each site. This result points to the difficulty of taking general management measures and highlights the need for management strategies at the local level.","2021-08","2023-09-26 16:12:44","2023-09-26 16:12:44","","","","","167","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000660290900001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;94</p>","","","Beach erosion; Climate change; Climate change uncertainty; COMPLEXITY; Embayed beach; EUROPE; MODEL; MORPHODYNAMICS; Numerical model; Probabilistic shoreline changes; SCALE; SEA-LEVEL RISE; Sediment transport; SHORELINE CHANGE; Synthetic time series; WAVE CLIMATE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In response, efforts promoting climate change adaptation strategies that improve ecosystem resilience and/or mitigate climate impacts are paramount. Invasive Alien Species are a key threat to islands globally, where strategies such as preventing establishment (biosecurity), and eradication, especially invasive mammals, have proven effective for reducing native biodiversity loss and can also advance ecosystem resilience and create refugia for native species at risk from climate change. Furthermore, there is growing evidence that successful eradications may also contribute to mitigating climate change. Given the cross-sector potential for eradications to reduce climate impacts alongside native biodiversity conservation, we sought to understand when conservation managers and funders explicitly sought to use or fund the eradication of invasive mammals from islands to achieve positive climate outcomes. To provide context, we first summarized available literature of the synergistic relationship between invasive species and climate change, including case studies where invasive mammal eradications served to meet climate adaptation or mitigation solutions. Second, we conducted a systematic review of the literature and eradication-related conference proceedings to identify when these synergistic effects of climate and invasive species were explicitly addressed through eradication practices. Third, we reviewed projects from four large funding entities known to support climate change solutions and/or native biodiversity conservation efforts and identified when eradications were funded in a climate change context. The combined results of our case study summary paired with systematic reviews found that, although eradicating invasive mammals from islands is an effective climate adaptation strategy, island eradications are poorly represented within the climate change adaptation and mitigation funding framework. We believe this is a lost opportunity and encourage eradication practitioners and funders of climate change adaptation to leverage this extremely effective nature-based tool into positive conservation and climate resilience solutions.","2021-12","2023-09-26 16:12:44","2023-09-26 16:12:44","","","","12","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000743065600001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;178</p>","","","SEA-LEVEL RISE; BIODIVERSITY; biosecurity; climate adaptation; climate change funding; climate change strategies; climate mitigation; climate resilience; conservation refugia; cross-sector funding; FOOD SECURITY; INTRODUCED RATS; invasive alien species; island eradication; nature-based solutions; PASSIVE RECOVERY; RAT ERADICATION; RODENT OUTBREAKS; SANTA-CRUZ ISLAND; SEABIRD RESTORATION; WATER-QUALITY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A limited range of data offers just one of many realizations that occurred in the past or will occur in the future; thus, it cannot sufficiently explain climate internal variability (CIV). In this study, future relationships among rainfall intensity (RI), duration, and frequency (called the IDF curve) are established by addressing the CIV and tail characteristics with respect to frequency. Specifically, 100 ensembles of 30-year time series data were created to quantify that uncertainty. Then, the tail characteristics of future extreme rainfall events were investigated to determine whether they will remain similar to those in the present. From the RIs computed for control and future periods under two emission scenarios, following are the key results. Firstly, future RI will increase significantly for most locations, especially near the end of this century. Secondly, the spatial distributions and patterns indicate higher RI in coastal areas and lower RI for the central inland areas of South Korea, and those distributions are similar to those of the climatological mean (CM) and CIV. Thirdly, a straightforward way to reveal whether the tail characteristics of future extreme rainfall events are the same as those in the present is to inspect the slope value for the factor of change (FOC), mFOC. Fourthly, regionalizing with nearby values is very risky when investigating future changes in precipitation frequency estimates. Fifthly, the magnitude of uncertainty is large when the data length is short and gradually decreases as the data length increases for all return periods, but the uncertainty range becomes much greater as the return period becomes large. Lastly, inferring future changes in RI from the CM is feasible only for small return periods and at locations where mFOC is close to zero.","2021-10","2023-09-26 16:12:44","2023-09-26 16:12:44","","","","20","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000716724200001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;58</p>","","","climate change; MODEL; CHALLENGES; climate internal variability; EXTREMES; factor of change; FRAMEWORK; IDF curve; MULTIMODEL ENSEMBLE; PRECIPITATION; precipitation frequency estimates; QUANTIFICATION; RAINFALL IDF CURVES; SIMULATIONS; tail characteristics; UNCERTAINTY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Study focus: This study aims to better understand the hydrological behavior of WAS watersheds, which experienced Sahelian hydrological paradoxes (SHP). Budyko framework was employed to evaluate the impact of climate change, environmental change and climate-environment interaction on surface runoff change in seven nested watersheds (38 - 21,178 km(2)) over the period 1965-2018. New hydrological insights for the region: Based on time-series stationarity statistical tests, the study period was divided into one baseline period (1965-1977) and three impacted periods (1978 1994, 1995 2006 and 2007 2018). Compared to the baseline period, the period 1978 1994 was characterized by a decrease in precipitation and an increase in runoff (first SHP). During the period 1995-2018, the runoff coefficient, which increased despite the observed regreening, was interpreted as evidence of the second SHP. The impact study showed that environmental change was the main driver of the first SHP (contribution reached +175 %), then climate-environment interaction became increasingly dominant during the second SHP (contribution reaching +68 %). The watersheds evolution in Budyko framework showed that the Fu Budyko-type model parameter appears to be a good indicator of soil water holding capacity spatio-temporal variability. Our results highlight the consequences of climate and environmental changes on surface runoff in the Sahelian context and might help in developing informed land management and restoration strategies to control runoff coefficients.","2021-06","2023-09-26 16:12:44","2023-09-26 16:12:44","","","","","35","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000663478500007","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;14<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;15<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;106</p>","","","RAINFALL; RIVER-BASIN; Climate change; Budyko framework; BURKINA-FASO; Climate-environment interaction; Environmental change; EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; LAND-USE; Nakanbe River watershed; RUNOFF; Sahelian hydrological paradox; SOIL-MOISTURE; STREAMFLOW; USE-EFFICIENCY; VEGETATION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using 46 moderate- and high-resolution satellite images, including declassified Keyhole and Landsat missions between 1964 and 2020, we provide a comprehensive area mapping of glaciers and glacial lakes in the Tama Koshi (Rongxer) basin, a highly glacierized China-Nepal transnational catchment in the central Himalayas with high potential risks of glacier-related hazards. Results show that the 329.2 +/- 1.9 km(2) total area of 271 glaciers in the region has decreased by 26.2 +/- 3.2 km(2) in the past 56 years. During 2000-2016, remarkable ice mass loss caused the mean glacier surface elevation to decrease with a rate of -0.63 m a(-1), and the mean glacier surface velocity slowed by similar to 25% between 1999 and 2015. The total area of glacial lakes increased by 9.2 +/- 0.4 km(2) (similar to 180%) from 5.1 +/- 0.1 km(2) in 1964 to 14.4 +/- 0.3 km(2) in 2020, while ice-contacted proglacial lakes have a much higher expansion rate (similar to 204%). Large-scale glacial lakes are developed preferentially and experienced rapid expansion on the east side of the basin, suggesting that in addition to climate warming, the glacial geomorphological characters (aspect and slope) are also key controlling factors of the lake growing process. We hypothesize that lake expansion will continue in some cases until critical local topography (i.e., steepening icefall) is reached, but the lake number may not necessarily increase. Further monitoring should be focused on eight rapidly expanding proglacial lakes due to their high potential risks of failure and relatively high lake volumes.","2021-09","2023-09-26 16:12:44","2023-09-26 16:12:44","","","","18","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000701480900001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;72</p>","","","climate change; ASIA; central Himalaya; CLIMATE-CHANGE; glacial lake change; glacier change; GLOFs; HAZARD ASSESSMENT; INVENTORY; MOUNT EVEREST REGION; OUTBURST FLOODS; SNOW; Tama Koshi; TIBETAN PLATEAU; TSHO ROLPA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we review insights, approaches, and mechanisms by which global change drives disease emergence from a disease ecology perspective. We aim to spur more interdisciplinary collaboration with economists and identification of more effective and sustainable interventions to prevent disease emergence.

Thereafter, the effect of climate change was assessed using a hybrid downscaling approach to generate future weather data. The thermal comfort in different seasons was evaluated through maximum temperature reduction (MTR) and maximum temperature fluctuation reduction (MTFR), while the building's energy performance was analysed utilising seasonal and annual energy consumption reduction (ECR). Finally, the influence of climate change on the building's energy performance was studied and compared using the Degree-Day Method (DDM) and energy simulations. Based on the MTR and MTFR results; overall, PCM 18 demonstrated superior performance during the wintertime, while PCM 30 was the best in the swing and summer seasons. Both DDM and energy simulations showed that under future climate scenario (2095), the cooling energy demand would rise, whereas the heating energy demand would drop. For all cities except for Zhengzhou and Islamabad, PCM 28-PCM 30 could be used as optimum PCMs for both current and future climate scenarios. The optimum PCMs resulted in the annual ECR values of up to 37% for current and future climate scenarios. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Butterfly species were classified according to their distribution types (northern, southern, and miscellaneous) to examine the effect of climate change. They were also classified according to three different habitat types (forest interior, forest edge, and grassland) to examine the effect of habitat change. Three types of food niche (monophagous, oligophagous, and polyphagous) were identified. A community temperature index (CTI), based on the species temperature index of each species, was calculated for past and present butterfly communities to estimate range shifts of butterflies at the community level. At the species level, range shifts of butterflies were calculated as a shift of the mid-zone of the distribution range in terms of latitude and temperature. The results showed that a change in the occurrence of butterflies was not significantly different among the three distribution types. The CTIs were not different between past and present communities, and the mid-zones of distribution range in latitude and temperature did not change. These results indicate that the occurrence change of butterflies was not significantly influenced by climate change but was instead influenced by habitat change from bare-ground or grassland to forests over 60 years. There was an increase in forest species and a decrease in grassland species, reflecting the effects of large-scale reforestation in South Korea over the last few decades. The reforestation has resulted in an increase in monophagous (oak-feeding) butterflies. Our results show that habitat change played a key role in the occurrence of Korean butterflies and may be confounding any possible influence of climate change. (c) 2021 The Authors.

In merging these perspectives, this analysis uses ESS Round 8 data from 23 European countries to examine whether climate change scepticism and concern, pro-environmental personal norm and a willingness to engage in energy-saving behaviour exhibit, first, urban-rural and/or regional differences, and second, if these attitudes can be explained at individual level by socioeconomic position and wellbeing resources. We find that climate change scepticism and concern do exhibit urban-rural differences, where living in a country village is associated with greater climate scepticism and lower concern compared to living in a big city. Also, higher climate change concern and pro-environmental norms are associated with living in a region with constant population growth. These geographical differences are independent of individual-level socioeconomic attributes as well as one's political orientation. Additionally, the results show that both climate change attitudes and reporting energysaving behaviour are strongly stratified by level of education and reveal that those in lower income deciles feel less pro-environmental norm but nonetheless report greater engagement with energy-saving behaviour. In sum, the results highlight that climate change mitigation is not a uniform project either spatially or within certain socioeconomic strata. Hence, our results suggest that socioeconomic disadvantage (belonging to the lowest education and income levels) and spatial marginalisation (living in more rural surroundings and declining regions) should be better acknowledged when reworking climate change and environmental policies in the EU.","2022-01","2023-09-26 16:12:44","2023-09-26 16:12:44","","","","","72","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000744160700003","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;9<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;9<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;69</p>","","","Climate change; MODEL; ATTITUDES; BEHAVIOR; Climate change attitudes; DETERMINANTS; ENERGY; ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERN; IDENTITY; LIFE-STYLES; POVERTY; Pro-environmental behaviour; RURAL-URBAN DIFFERENCES; Social exclusion; Spatial justice; Urban -rural differences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The language around climate action has shifted tangibly over the last five years to reflect this. Indeed, thousands of local governments, national governments, universities and scientists have declared a climate emergency. Some commentators argue that the emergency framing conveys a new and more appropriate level of urgency needed to respond to climate challenges; to create a social tipping point in the fight against climate change. Others are concerned to move on from such emergency rhetoric to urgent action. Beyond emergency declarations, new spaces of, and places for, engagement with climate change are emerging. The public square, the exhibition hall, the law courts, and the investors' forum are just some of the arenas where climate change politics are now being negotiated. Emergent governing mechanisms are being utilised, from citizens' assemblies to ecocide lawsuits. New social movements from Extinction Rebellion to Fridays For Future demonstrate heightened concern and willingness to undertake civil disobedience and protest against climate inaction. Yet questions remain which are addressed in this thematic issue: Are these discourses and spaces of engagement manifestations of a radical new climate politics? And if these are new climate politics, do they mark a shift of gear in current discourses with the potential to effect transformative climate action and support a just transition to a decarbonised world?","2021","2023-09-26 16:12:44","2023-09-26 16:12:44","","1-7","","2","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000645235800001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;8<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;8<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;30</p>","","","climate change; climate assemblies; climate emergency; climate politics; Green New Deal; just transition; youth movements","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The authors investigate trajectories of climate change worry through adolescence and associations with measures of depression and engagement with news and politics in late adolescence. Their objective is to explore whether climate change worry is a constructive or unconstructive psychological phenomenon. Their conclusion is that it is mainly an adaptive response but, for some groups, such as young people with pre-existing mental health problems, climate change worry could exacerbate their difficulties. In this commentary, it is argued that since research has found diverse results regarding whether climate worry is adaptive or not, one should perhaps not focus so much on the emotion itself, but rather on how people cope with their worry. Some examples of how young people cope with climate change are presented, and it is argued that taking account of these coping strategies in future longitudinal studies would be beneficial.","2022-02","2023-09-26 16:12:44","2023-09-26 16:12:44","","89-91","","1","27","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000729671700001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;11</p>","","","CHILDREN; climate change engagement; Climate change worry; COMMUNICATION; coping; CRISIS; meaning-focused coping; subjective well-being; young people","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mexico was one of the first countries to adopt a climate change act, the 2012 General Law on Climate Change (referred to as the Mexican Climate Act, MCA). However, Mexico has been unable to fulfil its self-imposed climate goals and the innovative national climate legislation has only produced limited results. By assessing the functioning of the Inter-Ministerial Commission on Climate Change (CICC) and the National System on Climate Change (SINACC), this article analyses how and why climate policy fragmentation occurs during MCA implementation. This paper argues that the lack of integration observed in the Mexican case is the result of a dynamic process characterized by multi-level paralysis, which is caused by three interconnected factors: (1) weakness of the Mexican federal system affecting vertical integration of climate policy (CPI); (2) ambiguities in MCA mandates impeding horizontal CPI; and (3) uneven leadership in Mexican climate policy that generates a breach between promises made abroad and actual domestic implementation capacities. The empirical findings of this paper are based upon quantitative and qualitative content analyses applied to the minutes of meetings of both the CICC and the SINACC, together with 22 elite-interviews with officers close to the policy process. This paper concludes that if there is a blueprint for organizing the Mexican administrative system, it has to start with rethinking the role of climate federalism. Key policy insights Mexican climate policy suffers from policy fragmentation and administrative instruments conceived for integration are not functioning properly. A reform of both is needed. Three interconnected factors generate policy fragmentation in Mexico: weakness of the Mexican federal system affecting collaboration across levels of government (vertical CPI); ambiguities in MCA mandates impeding coordination (horizontal CPI); and uneven leadership that generates a breach between the promises made abroad and actual domestic implementation capacities. Mexico has to rethink the role of climate federalism. The country adopted a model not suitable to its political and administrative culture.","2021-10-21","2023-09-26 16:12:43","2023-09-26 16:12:43","","1175-1189","","9","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000626987600001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;10<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;11<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;34</p>","","","administrative instruments for integration; climate change act; climate leadership; Climate policy integration; Mexican climate policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Predicting species responses requires understanding how species track environmental change, and how such tracking shapes communities. Growing empirical evidence suggests that how species track phenologically - how an organism shifts the timing of major biological events in response to the environment - is linked to species performance and community structure. Such research tantalizingly suggests a potential framework to predict the winners and losers of climate change, and the future communities we can expect. But developing this framework requires far greater efforts to ground empirical studies of phenological tracking in relevant ecological theory. Here we review the concept of phenological tracking in empirical studies and through the lens of coexistence theory to show why a community-level perspective is critical to accurate predictions with climate change. While much current theory for tracking ignores the importance of a multi-species context, basic community assembly theory predicts that competition will drive variation in tracking and trade-offs with other traits. We highlight how existing community assembly theory can help understand tracking in stationary and non-stationary systems. But major advances in predicting the species- and community-level consequences of climate change will require advances in theoretical and empirical studies. We outline a path forward built on greater efforts to integrate priority effects into modern coexistence theory, improved empirical estimates of multivariate environmental change, and clearly defined estimates of phenological tracking and its underlying environmental cues.","2021-12","2023-09-26 16:12:43","2023-09-26 16:12:43","","2810-2827","","6","96","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000674887100001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;7<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;7<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;149</p>","","","climate change; CLIMATE-CHANGE; global change; community assembly; EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; environmental variability; FLOWERING PHENOLOGY; LEAF TRAITS; phenology; PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; PLANT PHENOLOGY; RAPID EVOLUTION; REPRODUCTIVE PHENOLOGY; SHOOT GROWTH; WILD BIRD","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mitigation efforts so far have mostly focused on reducing the emissions intensity of energy. Future decarbonisation must look outside the energy sector to disrupt markets, infrastructure, systems and behaviour. This study quantifies the disruption to technological markets and individual behaviours embodied in possible decarbonisation pathways for the United Kingdom. We review 12 strategies for decarbonisation proposed by a range of sources, including public and industry bodies, academic organisations and advocacy groups. The broad scope of perspectives yields a large set of possible mitigation options. A novel metric captures the embedded disruption across dual axes of technological and behavioural change. We find a distinct bias towards technological disruption through the pursuit of fast deployment and speculative technologies. Behavioural mitigation remains undervalued. The predominance of supply-side decarbonisation in global climate discourse means that a technological bias, illustrated here for the UK, is seen in mitigation strategies across the world. Historical evidence shows that technological diffusion takes decades, especially in energy markets, while behaviour change can be swifter. A technological bias reduces the likelihood of achieving net zero global emissions in time to limit global warming to 2 degrees C. To win the race against climate change, governments should rebalance policy efforts and spending across technological and behavioural options for mitigation.","2021-08","2023-09-26 16:12:43","2023-09-26 16:12:43","","","","","78","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000672861200018","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;23<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;23<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;81</p>","","","climate change; behaviour change; CLIMATE; Decarbonisation; disruption; DYNAMICS; LONG; technology diffusion; transitions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Eurasia contains the largest endorheic zone with several large terminal lakes, whose water levels recently underwent remarkable variations. To address the patterns of these variations and their links to the climate change, we investigated the variability of levels in 15 lakes of three neighboring endorheic regions-Central Asia, Tibetan Plateau, and Mongolian Plateau. Satellite altimetry revealed a heterogeneous pattern among the regions during 1992-2018: lake levels increased significantly in Central Asia and the Tibetan Plateau but decreased on the Mongolian Plateau. The shifts to the increasing trend were detected since 1997 in Central Asia, since 1998 in the southern part of the Tibetan Plateau, and since 2005 in its northern part. The shift in air temperatures around 1997 and the precipitation shifts around 1998 and 2004 contributed to the trend's turning points, with precipitation being the major contributor to the heterogeneous pattern of lake levels. Our findings reveal the linkage of the heterogeneous pattern of lake levels to climatic factors in the endorheic basins, providing a further understanding of the hydrological regime in the Eurasian endorheic zone and its sensitivity to climate change.","2021-09","2023-09-26 16:12:43","2023-09-26 16:12:43","","","","18","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000701466200001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;85</p>","","","climate change; BIODIVERSITY; TIBETAN PLATEAU; BALKHASH; CENTRAL-ASIA; change point; CHANGE-POINTS; COMPONENTS; CYCLE; lake; MANN-KENDALL; PRECIPITATION DATA SETS; RIVER; satellite altimetry; water level","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Citizen science programs such as the Catalan Butterfly Monitoring Scheme make it possible to study butterfly responses in the long term and over wide spatial scales, which thus helps understand the drivers of global change that are affecting them. In this work a novel methodology and the CBMS data have been used to calculate trends for a hundred species from three climatic regions: Alpine, humid Mediterranean and arid Mediterranean. A comparison between regions of the trends of a number of common species was made, as well as the relationship between these trends and species' ecological characteristics. Changes in the communities at a number of long-term monitored sites were also studied in the Alpine region using several community indices. The results show that in the three regions the percentage of species in decline exceeds that of the species that are increasing. Nevertheless, these comparisons were made using a mainly generalist fraction of the fauna and probably underestimate the declines that certain rare species are suffering. In common species, declines were more severe in the arid Mediterranean region than in the Alpine region. In this latter region there was no relationship between population trends and the ecological indices of the species. Conversely, significant changes were detected in certain community indices at local level, mainly due to the abandonment of grazing and the movement of thermophilic species towards higher altitudes.","2021-01","2023-09-26 16:12:43","2023-09-26 16:12:43","","","","1","30","","","","","","","","","","Spanish","","","","WOS:000646252200013","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;42</p>","","","climate change; BIODIVERSITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; 2 DECADES; butterflies; climatic regions; COMMUNITIES; DECLINE; GENERALISTS; HABITAT; habitat change; IMPACTS; indicators; POPULATIONS; SPECIES RICHNESS; trends","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Several studies have addressed the separate impacts of either land-use or climate change on the watershed hydrology, but few have explored the combined impacts. In this study, the SWAT model was applied to evaluate the combined impacts of land-use and climate change on hydrological responses in Gumara watershed. This study examined four land-use scenarios that include the present and projected land-use based on the businessas-usual trend (BAU), expansion of irrigation crop (EIC), and expansion of forestland (EFL). Climate variables were simulated using Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model for the baseline (2005-2015) and projected period (2045-2055) under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. Results showed that SR increase by 5.1% under BAU scenario while BF decrease by 6.5% without altering SF and ET noticeably. On the contrary, SF decrease by 12.5% and 5.2% respectively under EIC and EFL scenarios, while ET increase by 4.8% and 8.9% respectively under EIC and EFL scenarios. The simulated SF, SR, and ET under RCP8.5 may increase significantly by 34.3%, 51.8%, and 12.2%, respectively. Similarly, the simulated SF, SR and ET may increase significantly under the combination of all three land-use and RCP8.5 scenarios. This suggested that climate change will have a greater effect on hydrologic responses than land-use change. The results of this study can be useful to decision-makers and planners in the design of adaptive measures to climate and land-use change.

In boreal North America, black spruce shapes forest flammability and depends on fire for regeneration. This relationship has helped black spruce maintain its dominance through much of the Holocene. However, with climate change and more frequent and severe fires, shifts away from black spruce dominance to broadleaf or pine species are emerging, with implications for ecosystem functions including carbon sequestration, water and energy fluxes, and wildlife habitat. Here, we predict that such reductions in black spruce after fire may already be widespread given current trends in climate and fire. To test this, we synthesize data from 1,538 field sites across boreal North America to evaluate compositional changes in tree species following 58 recent fires (1989 to 2014). While black spruce was resilient following most fires (62%), loss of resilience was common, and spruce regeneration failed completely in 18% of 1,140 black spruce sites. In contrast, postfire regeneration never failed in forests dominated by jack pine, which also possesses an aerial seed bank, or broad-leaved trees. More complete combustion of the soil organic layer, which often occurs in better-drained landscape positions and in dryer duff, promoted compositional changes throughout boreal North America. Forests in western North America, however, were more vulnerable to change due to greater long-term climate moisture deficits. While we find considerable remaining resilience in black spruce forests, predicted increases in climate moisture deficits and fire activity will erode this resilience, pushing the system toward a tipping point that has not been crossed in several thousand years.","2021-11-09","2023-09-26 16:12:43","2023-09-26 16:12:43","","","","45","118","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000720926900004","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;75<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;76<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;77</p>","","","climate change; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BURN SEVERITY; ecological state change; NORTH-AMERICA; PICEA-MARIANA; PINUS-BANKSIANA; POPULUS-TREMULOIDES; R PACKAGE; resilience; RESILIENCE; TREE RECRUITMENT; tree regeneration; wildfire; WILDFIRE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We then quantified the contribution and interactions effects of climatic factors (temperature and precipitation) and anthropogenic factors (population, gross domestic product and other four categories of forestry investment) on vegetation change in five typical areas of China. Both NDVI and LAI across China demonstrated a significant increasing trend over the past two decades. However, the eastern developmental regions such as Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region and Yangtze River Delta exhibited a decreasing trend due to fast urbanization. Socio-economical inputs (the explanatory power of forestry investment > 40%, the range of explanatory power is 0 to 100%) were identified as the dominant driving forces of vegetation change for the most of study areas. Precipitation was the most important natural influencing factor of vegetation change. We also found that the interactions between forestry investment and other factors presented much greater explanatory power on vegetation change than a single factor. Our research highlights that the afforestation program in China during the past several decades plays an important role in contributing to vegetation greening across the country. Greening and degradation, however, are largely related to landscape context, which could be due to natural change and anthropogenic impact. To maintain high levels of forests, conserving the vegetation is more important than increasing the economic development.","2021-07","2023-09-26 16:12:43","2023-09-26 16:12:43","","","","","126","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000647804700006","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;47<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;54<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;72</p>","","","Climate change; Vegetation change; China; RESPONSES; Anthropogenic activities; COVER; DISTURBANCE; ECOSYSTEMS; ENVIRONMENTAL-FACTORS; FOREST; Geodetector; Greening; INDEX; LOESS PLATEAU; NDVI; RESTORATION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Rainfall days were extracted in January using data from 42 synoptic stations in the south and southwest regions of Iran. Then, the rainy days due to the Sudan low system were separated from the precipitation of the other atmospheric systems using the visual analysis of the maps. The synoptic analysis indicated that the sea level pressure has been decreasing at all sampling stations from the first to the sixth decade. Furthermore, decreasing elevation to -80 m (negative anomaly) in the 500 hPa level atmosphere from the first decade to the sixth decade, indicated further atmospheric instability and more strengthening of the Sudan low compared to previous decades. The contribution of advection moisture to the area increased within the region at 700 hPa. This implies that the role of the transferred moisture from the intertropical convergence zone is increasing in the systems transferred from Sudan and in the study area. In general, the share of Sudan low precipitation is increasing in the south and southwest regions of Iran. This result is a positive effect of the climate change on the study area.","2022-02","2023-09-26 16:12:43","2023-09-26 16:12:43","","1056-1072","","2","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000729438700001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;67</p>","","","climate change; CLIMATOLOGY; dynamic change; EXTREME PRECIPITATION EVENTS; Iran; MIDDLE-EAST; RED-SEA; REGIMES; solar cycle; SOLAR VARIABILITY; STORMS; Sudan low; VORTEX; WET","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The main purpose of this study is to assess the spatiotemporal changes in extreme precipitation indices over Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, between the near (2021-2050) and intermediate (2051-2080) future periods with respect to the baseline period (1980-2009). The historical extreme indices were calculated through observed daily rainfall data at 11 selected meteorological stations across the study area. The future extreme indices were projected based on a stochastic weather generator, the Long Ashton Research Station Weather Generator (LARS-WG), which incorporates climate projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) ensemble. Eight extreme precipitation indices, such as the consecutive dry days (CDDs), consecutive wet days (CWDs), number of very heavy precipitation days (R20mm), number of extremely heavy precipitation days (R25mm), maximum 1 d precipitation amount (RX1day), maximum 5 d precipitation amount (RX5day), very wet days (R95p), and simple daily intensity index (SDII) were selected to evaluate the multi-model ensemble mean changes of extreme indices in terms of intensity, duration, and frequency. The statistical significance, stability, and averaged magnitude of trends in these changes, thereby, were computed by the Mann-Kendall statistical techniques and Sen's estimator, and applied to each extreme index. The results indicated a general increasing trend in most extreme indices for the future periods. In comparison with the near future period (2021-2050), the extreme intensity and frequency indices in the intermediate future period (2051-2080) present more statistically significant trends and higher growing rates. Furthermore, an increase in most extreme indices mainly occurs in some parts of the central and southern regions, while a decrease in those indices is often projected in the north of the study area.","2021-01","2023-09-26 16:12:43","2023-09-26 16:12:43","","","","2","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000611763000001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;7<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;7<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;64</p>","","","climate change; RAINFALL; TEMPERATURE; TRENDS; RIVER-BASIN; MANN-KENDALL; CMIP5; extreme precipitation; FREQUENCY; LARS-WG; MODELS; REGION; spatiotemporal changes; TESTS; WEATHER EVENTS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Exploring lake responses to plausible future climate scenarios can provide important information needed to inform stakeholders of likely effects of hydrologic changes on these waterbodies in coming decades. To assess potential climate effects on lake hydrology, we combined a previously published spatially explicit, processed-based hydrologic modeling framework implemented over the lake-rich landscape of the Northern Highlands Lake District within the United States with an ensemble of climate change scenarios for the 2050s (2041-2070) and 2080s (2071-2100). Model results quantify the effects of climate change on water budgets and lake stage elevations for 3692 lakes and highlight the importance of landscape and hydrologic setting for the response of specific lake types to climate change. All future climate projections resulted in loss of ice cover and snowpack as well as increased evaporation, but variability in climate projections (warmer conditions, wet winters combined with wet or dry summers) interacted with lake characteristics and landscape position to produce variable lake hydrologic changes. Water levels for drainage lakes (lakes with substantial surface water inflows and outflows) showed nearly no change, whereas minimum water levels for seepage lakes (minimal surface water fluxes) decreased by an average of up to 2.64 m by the end of the 21st century. Our physically based modeling approach is parsimonious and computationally efficient and can be applied to other lake-rich regions to investigate interregional variability in lake hydrologic response to future climate scenarios.","2021-07-03","2023-09-26 16:12:43","2023-09-26 16:12:43","","335-350","","3","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000680291900001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;35</p>","","","climate change; GREAT-LAKES; groundwater; hydrologic change; lake response; SENTINELS; surface water; TERRESTRIAL","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The first phase of the methodology included a coastline change analysis using historical aerial photographs in a geographic information system to identify the most vulnerable sections of the coastline. To better understand the calculated changes, the second phase explored the roles of select climatic and non-climatic drivers of coastline change, such as historic storms and land use changes. The results indicated that four main areas of Lincoln's coast were more vulnerable, with rates of erosion between -0.32 and -0.66 m/yr between 1934 and 2018. Sections of coastline that had less erosion included those that were more heavily vegetated, attempted a cooperative protection approach, or utilized revetment stones in areas without steep banks. This methodology can help municipalities understand coastline change in a more holistic way to increase their adaptive capacity and allows for the creation of useful visualizations that better communicate to residents and town staff the level of vulnerability of their coasts.","2021-06","2023-09-26 16:12:42","2023-09-26 16:12:42","","","","6","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000666125500001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;84</p>","","","climate change; SHORELINE CHANGE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; IMPACTS; ACCURACY; aerial photography; coastal vulnerability; COASTAL VULNERABILITY; coastline change; COMMUNITY RESILIENCE; erosion; EROSION; PEOPLE; POINT-PELEE; TOOL","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we describe 11 informative core indicators of forests and climate change impacts with metrics available or nearly available for use in the NCA efforts. The recommended indicators are based on a comprehensive conceptual model which recognizes forests as a land use, an ecosystem, and an economic sector. The indicators cover major forest attributes such as extent, structural components such as biomass, functions such as growth and productivity, and ecosystem services such as biodiversity and outdoor recreation. Interactions between humans and forests are represented through indicators focused on the wildland-urban interface, cost to mitigate wildfire risk, and energy produced from forest-based biomass. Selected indicators also include drought and disturbance from both wildfires and biotic agents. The forest indicators presented are an initial set that will need further refinement in coordination with other NCA indicator teams.

The resulting dramatic increase in the turbidity of the water seriously affected the water supply. To effectively maintain the stability of the water supply and maintain the reservoir's storage capacity, the government of Taiwan began to plan and construct a series of improvement measures, such as a sediment flushing tunnel, the JhongJhuang Bank-Side Reservoir, and the Amuping Desilting Tunnel. However, previous studies only focused on the impact of the sediment flushing tunnel and the Amuping Desilting Tunnel on the downstream riverbed, and did not consider the possibility of increasing sediment discharge after the completion of the JhongJhuang Bank-Side Reservoir. In addition, climate change will cause the intensity of extreme rainfall to increase enormously in the future. That rainfall and extra sediment flushing will challenge the existing flood prevention facilities. Therefore, this study considered that the JhongJhuang Bank-Side Reservoir will increase sediment discharge of the Shihmen Reservoir, and used dynamical downscaling extreme typhoon data of climate change under the RCP 8.5 scenario to explore the flood prevention and riverbed migration of the main channels of the Dahan and Tamsui Rivers in the future. We used the rainfall-runoff model of Hydrologic Modeling System to simulate rainfall and runoff, and used the hydraulic and sediment transport model of CCHE1D to holistically simulate flood events and consequent river scouring and deposition behaviors. Our results showed that the projected peak discharge during the late 21st century (2075 to 2099) will be at least 50% higher than that during the baseline (1979 to 2003) period. In terms of flood prevention, the potential of overbank flooding will increase in the downstream area, and the trend of long-term change in the riverbed will be dominated by degradation (-0.489 +/- 0.743 m) in the future. The improvement measures will have a limited impact on riverbed migration (0.011 +/- 0.094 m) in the Dahan and Tamsui Rivers. After the operation of the JhongJhuang Bank-Side Reservoir, the Shihmen Reservoir is expected to increase the sediment discharge ratio by 70% during floods, and it will not cause excessive water turbidity that may affect downstream water supply.","2021-07","2023-09-26 16:12:42","2023-09-26 16:12:42","","67-81","","","37","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000669035000006","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;44</p>","","","Climate change; MODEL; SIMULATIONS; Desiltation measures; GCM; Long-term change; NONUNIFORM SEDIMENT TRANSPORT; Riverbed migration; TROPICAL CYCLONES","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Coupled scenarios, which were split into individual and combined simulations such as climate change (CC), LCC, CLC change, and daily streamflow were simulated in the Soil and Water Assessment Tool. The interannual variability of streamflow was higher in the lower urbanized area than the upper forested region. The watershed runoff was projected to be more sensitive to CC than LCC. Under the CLC scenario, the top 10% peak flow and the 7-day low flow are expected to increase (2-19%) and decrease (+9 to -20 cm s), respectively, in both future periods. The center timing of runoff in the year is projected to shift 2-3 weeks earlier in response to warming temperature and more winter precipitation falling as rain.

However, the major driving factor of vegetation coverage change in these areas remains unclear, with climate change and anthropogenic factors playing interactive roles under different soil and terrain conditions. Comprehensively understanding the underlying drivers of vegetation change can provide references for regulating environmental management and prevention of vegetation degradation. In this paper, a structural equation modeling (SEM) method was employed to quantify the effects of fundamental natural environment (i.e. the relative stable variables including soil and topography), climate change and human activity change on vegetation coverage change in Jiangsu province, China from 2000 to 2015. Four variables including land use, population density, road impact and night lights were used to indicate human activities. The results showed that the increase of NDVI smaller than 0.10 covered 39.13% of the study area while the decrease of NDVI larger than 0.10 accounted for 20.23%. Areas with NDVI increase mainly distributed in croplands in northern Jiangsu. This could be explained by the increase of crop yield due to the development of modern agriculture. The decrease of NDVI was mainly observed in southern Jiangsu with higher urbanization level and city centers in northern Jiangsu, indicating the effect of rapid urbanization on vegetation degradation. The constructed SEM model suggested that the total effects (influential coefficients) of fundamental natural environment, climate change, and human activity change on NDVI change in Jiangsu were -0.24, 0.17, and -0.74, respectively. Although the fundamental natural environment didn't have a direct effect on NDVI change, but it had an indirect effect through interactions with human activities. We also constructed SEM models for northern and southern Jiangsu separately, due to their different natural environment and changing patterns of climate change. The results indicated the different driving mechanisms of NDVI change in northern and southern Jiangsu. Furthermore, the results suggested night light as the best indicator of human activity change, followed by the road impact index. We concluded that our study offered a framework to better understand and explain the complex interrelationships behind the spatial temporal change of NDVI. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study we have completed shoreline change analysis from aerial imagery spanning >60 years for all the beaches within the Noosa Headland (Queensland, Australia) region to better understand how sediment moves between compartments. Shoreline change of each compartment was evaluated in conjunction with local wave data and regional climate indices. Headland bypassing may only occur following a specific sequence of wave events, with a moderate (Hs > 2.5 m) downdrift oblique wave event being followed by a moderate shore-normal/updrift oblique wave event. Long term beach accretion of 0.56 m/year (+/- 0.17), primarily due to intervention, was observed at headland adjacent beaches, with negligible change for the headland embayed beaches. Volume calculations from the headland sheltered Noosa Main Beach indicate a natural sediment budget of negative 8900 m(3)/year over an 11-year span, with sand backpassing used to recover these losses.

However, these rising temperatures may also lead to diminished frost hardiness in plants due to their insufficient hardening. Despite climate warming exerting such dual effects on frost damage, how this might change the frost damage of woody plants remains unknown. Here, we conducted a laboratory experiment that used the relative electrolyte leakage method to derive species-specific model parameters for frost hardiness and a damage model. Then we simulated the daily frost hardiness and damage of five typical temperate tree species (Ulmus pumila, Robinia pseudoacacia, Fraxinus chinensis, Salix babylonica, and Armeniaca vulgaris), from 1980 to 2015, in Beijing, China. The root mean square error (RMSE) between observed and predicted frost damage ranged from 3.58% to 7.65%. According to our simulation results, frost hardiness has declined over this 36-year period due to insufficient cold hardening of plants in autumn coupled with rapid dehardening in spring; however, the percentage of frost damage incurred by the five species showed a declining trend because of the reduced frequency and intensity of frost events. Thus, decreased frost severity may, to a large extent, offset the negative effects of diminished frost hardiness such that the frost risk faced by temperate forests may well remain constant or decline with continued climate warming.","2021-03","2023-09-26 16:12:42","2023-09-26 16:12:42","","","","1-2","165","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000634802900004","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;49</p>","","","Climate change; Frost damage; Phenology; Temperate trees; Temperature change","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent research has offered different insights regarding the effect of technical change on CO2 emissions but ignored the bias of technical changes which lead to changes in CO2 emissions. To fill the gap, this paper uses the 2008 to 2015 provincial-level data on China's 22 industrial sub-sectors to investigate both the effect of directed technical change on CO2 emissions and its heterogeneity. We find that the technical change in most industrial sectors in China was capital-biased, although a labor-biased trend was evident. Labor-biased technical change is conducive to CO2 reduction, while capital-biased technical change has the opposite effect. Moreover, this effect is different by developmental periods, industries, and regions. Therefore, we propose that the government promotes labor-biased technical change based on the differentiated characteristics.","2021-07","2023-09-26 16:12:42","2023-09-26 16:12:42","","2463-2486","","3","107","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000604521200008","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;42</p>","","","ECONOMIC-GROWTH; Climate change; China; ENERGY-CONSUMPTION; PRODUCTIVITY; Carbon dioxide emissions; CO2 EMISSIONS; Directed technical change; EFFICIENCY; ENVIRONMENTAL-REGULATION; IMPACT FACTORS; INNOVATION; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; TECHNOLOGICAL-CHANGE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The ensemble of best top four models from both CMIP simulations is also used to investigate the future climate change under medium and high emissions for short, medium, and long terms. Results show CMIP6 products outperform CMIP5 in terms of accuracy statistics, particularly for precipitation. Overall, CMIP6 indicate less intermodel variability, implying the climate signal obtained via CMIP6 is improved relative to CMIP5. The CMIP6 reduce the error in precipitation and temperature 11% and 6%, respectively while increasing the correlation 13% for precipitation. Correlation is not changed for temperature. The substantial success of CMIP6 mainly manifests itself in the winter precipitation and autumn temperature. A slightly warmer (up to 0.35 ?C) climate from the CMIP6 is projected while precipitation change in mean precipitation decline is about 2.5% smaller for CMIP6. However, precipitation changes in maximum decline and increase are more noticeable for CMIP6, addressing the better resolving for future climate variability. The summer warming (up to 6.5 ?C) and drying (up to -40%) towards autumn spread across the country.

Weather conditions shape vulnerability to both loss of life and reduced fishing opportunities through their influence on fishers' daily participation decisions. The tradeoff between physical risk at sea and the economic rewards of continued fishing under adverse weather conditions is a critical component of fishers' trip decisions but is poorly understood. We employed a stated choice experiment with skippers from a temperate mixed-species fishery in southwest England to empirically assess how fishers trade off the risks from greater wind speed and wave height with the benefits of expected catch and prices. Technical fishing and socio-economic data were collected for individual fishers to identify the factors influencing trade-off decisions. Fishers preferred increased wind speed and wave height up to a threshold, after which they became increasingly averse to worsening conditions. Fishing gear, vessel length, presence of crew, vessel ownership, age, recent fishing success and reliance on fishing income all influenced the skippers' decisions to go to sea. This study provides a first insight into the socio-economic, environmental, and technical fishing factors that can influence the sensitivity of individual fishers to changing storminess. These insights can help to inform fisheries climate vulnerability assessments and the development of adaptation measures.","2021-07","2023-09-26 16:12:41","2023-09-26 16:12:41","","","","","69","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000683570700003","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;132</p>","","","Climate change; CLIMATE-CHANGE; Adaptation; Changing storminess; COMMERCIAL FISHERMEN; DECISION-MAKING; DISCRETE-CHOICE EXPERIMENTS; Extreme weather; Fisheries; HEALTH-CARE; PREFERENCES; SMALL-SCALE FISHERMEN; STATED CHOICE; SURVEY TRAWL; Vulnerability; WEATHER CONDITIONS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The attribution approach is applied to six sub-basins in Mekong River basin as a case study for attributing the decadal change in streamflow during 1960-2018 over the baseline (1960-1969). Results indicate that the observed streamflow decadal changes are mostly due to anthropogenic activities with some decadal contributions from changes in precipitation.

Drawing on insights gathered from conversations with natural and historic environment practitioners and regulators, this paper highlights current practice and policy around managed decline, with a focus on the English context. In seeking to address some of the limitations of current approaches, this paper introduces a new conceptual framework: adaptive release. Adaptive release, as presented here, reflects a decision to accommodate the dynamic transformation of a heritage asset and its associated values and significance, with reference to wider landscape settings. The focus is on iterative management over extended timeframes, involving some relinquishment of control and a commitment to ongoing monitoring and interpretation.

Growth, a trait that frequently influences fitness, is difficult to study as it is influenced by many environmental variables. To address this, we used a sliding window approach to determine the time windows when sea-surface and air temperatures have the potential to affect growth of black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla) on a colony in the Northeast Pacific. We examined environmental drivers influencing nestling growth using data from a long-term (21-year) study, that food supplements a portion of the colony. The associations between kittiwake growth and climatic conditions in our study indicated that warmer environmental conditions can both positively and negatively impact nestling growth parameters depending on hatching order. We found that first-hatched nestlings had a heavier maximum mass under warm air temperatures and cold sea conditions. Warmer air temperatures negatively affected the second-hatched nestling in a brood. However, when air temperatures were warm, warmer sea-surface temperatures predicted heavy, fast-growing second-hatched nestlings in contrast to what we observed for first-hatched nestlings. Food supplementation alleviated the temperature effects, and competition among nestlings influenced how strongly a variable affected growth. We identified windows that might indicate specific biological pathways through which environmental variation affected growth directly or indirectly. Overall, our windows suggest that nestlings in shared nests will be most affected by warming conditions.","2022-02","2023-09-26 16:12:41","2023-09-26 16:12:41","","307-318","","2","198","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000707901800004","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;59</p>","","","Climate change; BIRDS; RESPONSES; PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; CLIMATE; BODY-SIZE; BROOD REDUCTION; CHICK GROWTH; Development; Early life; FITNESS; FOOD; Phenotypic change; RISSA-TRIDACTYLA; Sibling interactions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During the examined period, fires affected 23.78% of the total Amazon Basin. Brazil had the largest affected area (220,087 fire foci, 773,360 km(2) burned area, 54.7% of the total burned in the Amazon Basin), followed by Bolivia (102,499 fire foci, 571,250 km(2) burned area, 40.4%).

But recent simulation-based research has called the reliability of resampling into question, and its utility has not been comprehensively evaluated. Here we combine long-term empirical data sets with novel community-level simulations to explore the accuracy of snapshot resampling of both population- and community-level metrics under a variety of conditions. We show that snapshot resampling often yields spurious conclusions, but the accuracy of results increases when inter-annual variability in the response variable is low or the magnitude of change through time is high. Snapshot resampling also generally performs better for community-level metrics (e.g., species richness) as opposed to population-level metrics pertaining to a single species (e.g., abundance). Finally, we evaluate strategies to improve the accuracy of snapshot resampling, including sampling multiple years at the end of the study, but these produce mixed results. Ultimately, we find that snapshot resampling should be used with caution, but under certain circumstances, can be a useful for understanding long-term global change impacts.","2021-05","2023-09-26 16:12:41","2023-09-26 16:12:41","","","","2","91","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000608263000001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;17<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;17<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;71</p>","","","climate change; global change; ecological time series; resampling; richness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is now considerable evidence of CC and LUC in many catchments in Malawi but without corresponding evaluations of their impacts on river flow regimes. Therefore, this study assessed how both factors affect the flow regime of Wamkurumadzi River, a key tributary of the major Shire River in southern Malawi. Land use and hydroclimatic data for the basin were first analyzed for spatial-temporal trends in the historical period between the years 1984 and 2015. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was then applied with different LUC and CC scenarios in order to assess their sole and combined impacts on the river flow regime. The model was calibrated and validated using the split sample method from the year 1984 to 1999 and from the year 2000 to 2015. Model performance was acceptable according to the selected evaluation criteria, with the Nash-Sutcliffe (NSE) coefficient of 0.78 and coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.96 during calibration and NSE of 0.93 and R-2 of 0.98 during validation. Results of the integrated impacts of LUC and CC suggest a slight increase in river discharge of 0.05 m(3)/s for the period between the 1980s and 2000s. During the 1980s-1990s, both CC through rainfall decreased and LUC resulted in decreases in the mean river discharges by 1.58 and 0.37 m(3)/s, respectively. The study also found that CC through increased rainfall in the 1990s-2000s decades saw an overall increase of 1.39 m(3)/s in mean river discharge, while LUC shows the increase of mean river discharge by 0.25 m(3)/s.

Constraints for uninitialized projections are generally based on model performance in simulating climatology and climate change. For initialized predictions, skill scores over the hindcast period provide insight into the relative performance of models, and the value of initialization as compared to projections. Predictions and projections combined can, in principle, provide seamless decadal to multi-decadal climate information. For that, though, the role of observations in skill estimates and constraints needs to be understood in order to use both consistently across the prediction and projection time horizons. This paper discusses the challenges in doing so, illustrated by examples of state-of-the-art methods for predicting and projecting changes in European climate. It discusses constraints across prediction and projection methods, their interpretation, and the metrics that drive them such as process accuracy, accurate trends or high signal-to-noise ratio. We also discuss the potential to combine constraints to arrive at more reliable climate prediction systems from years to decades. To illustrate constraints on projections, we discuss their use in the UK's climate prediction system UKCP18, the case of model performance weights obtained from the Climate model Weighting by Independence and Performance (ClimWIP) method, and the estimated magnitude of the forced signal in observations from detection and attribution. For initialized predictions, skill scores are used to evaluate which models perform well, what might contribute to this performance, and how skill may vary over time. Skill estimates also vary with different phases of climate variability and climatic conditions, and are influenced by the presence of external forcing. This complicates the systematic use of observational constraints. Furthermore, we illustrate that sub-selecting simulations from large ensembles based on reproduction of the observed evolution of climate variations is a good testbed for combining projections and predictions. Finally, the methods described in this paper potentially add value to projections and predictions for users, but must be used with caution.","2021-06-09","2023-09-26 16:12:41","2023-09-26 16:12:41","","","","","3","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001023248000001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;11<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;12<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;99</p>","","","climate change; VARIABILITY; UNCERTAINTY; SYSTEM; MODELS; ATTRIBUTION; climate modeling; climate predictions; DECADAL PREDICTION; EMERGENT CONSTRAINTS; FULL-FIELD; future projections; model evaluation; observational constraints; PREDICTABILITY; TEMPERATURE PROJECTIONS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study analyzed the changes in the timing of extreme precipitation in the Poyang Lake basin and projected its future changes for the period 2020-2099. The study also quantified the influences of changes in the timing of peak flows on lake floods based on a hydrodynamic model. The results showed that peak rainfall in the Poyang Lake basin had occurred on later dates during the period 1960-2012, and it is this change that caused a delay in peak streamflows from five rivers in the lake basin. Moreover, the effects of these changes are expected to be more prominent during 2020-2099; for example, the rate of delay will be about 2.0 days per 10 years both for peak rainfall and for streamflow in the Poyang Lake basin. The hydrodynamic simulation further showed that a delay of peak streamflows from five rivers would significantly increase the flood level and outflow of the lake and also prolong the duration of floods. These results indicate that the risk of floods in Poyang Lake is likely to increase in the future, therefore making flood control in this region more challenging.","2021-02","2023-09-26 16:12:40","2023-09-26 16:12:40","","26-42","","1","52","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000621369000003","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;9<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;10<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;89</p>","","","climate change; extreme precipitation; flood; Poyang Lake; timing change","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this paper is twofold: (i) we introduce a copula-based pricing methodology for multivariate CDs/WDs, whose flexible theoretical framework allows to be suited to any pricing application and possible structure of multivariate products, and (ii) we discuss the impact of CDs/WDs on climate risk and their implication for financial stability. Using the proposed framework, we illustrate a calibration example on a case study on Italian data. We find that Archimedean copula functions characterized by left tail dependence are generally more suitable to fit the data, depending on the season and the location. We also explore the advantages of using more sophisticated, i.e. multivariate, functions and assess the improvement of fitting. Subsequently, leveraging both the theoretical model and the empirical results, we discuss the relation between climate risk hedging and financial stability. Especially, we move from modeling complexities and limitations to illustrate how incorrect calculations (i.e. mispricings, or over/under estimations of capital at risk) can, alongside with climate change effect, increase rather than reduce the climate physical risk and hence the concerns for financial stability. Finally, we discuss this point in relation with the legislative framework, noting how, in the current context of uncertain legislation and imperfect pricing, climate hedging risks are likely to do more harm than good.

The framework was based on a proposal from the All Party Committee on Environmental Objectives (the Committee), in which members from all participating parliamentary parties agreed unanimously. This was despite a contested climate debate running in parallel, notwithstanding strong criticism from business confederations and trade unions. Aiming to draw lessons of value for climate policy-making, this study explores the main factors that influenced the work and outcomes of the Committee, based on a series of in-depth interviews and document review. The research design is linked to policy process theories. The interviews mainly concern underlying motives, the role of knowledge, the influence of impact assessments, and international influence. It is shown that a continuous and comprehensive learning process in the Committee was instrumental for achieving consensus, including addressing concerns among some members regarding policy costs and constitutionality. The Committee was also influenced by policy developments elsewhere, referred to as policy diffusion, notably from the U.K. Climate Change Act and the UNFCCC COP 21 policy process. Over time, a cross-party consensus among Committee members emerged and led to the invention of an original policy proposal. The consensus was instrumental for generating support for the proposal in an otherwise conflictual political landscape. As a result, a governmental bill based on the proposal was eventually enacted into law, renewing Sweden's climate policy with a climate change act coupled to ambitious climate objectives. Key policy insights Joint learning on factually complex and normatively contested climate issues requires time and comprehensive processes but can lead to policy inventions and ambitious outcomes. Policy diffusion between countries may be important for raising ambitions and shaping innovative, new elements of national climate policy. Framework climate change acts and specific climate laws can be mutually supportive, i.e. frameworks foster more ambitious sectoral laws and the more precise sectoral laws, the easier it is to agree on stricter overall ambitions. Adoption of more stringent climate policies may require precise dismantling of arguments working against action, in particular on policy costs.","2021-10-21","2023-09-26 16:12:40","2023-09-26 16:12:40","","1132-1145","","9","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000650974300001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;10<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;10<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;43</p>","","","Climate change act; climate policy; framework climate legislation; LEGISLATION; policy diffusion; policy invention","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To address this issue, we use a new collection of initial-condition large ensembles from the Community Earth System Model version 1 that are prescribed with different combinations of industrial aerosol and greenhouse gas forcing. To compare the climate response to these external forcings, we adopt an artificial neural network (ANN) architecture from previous work that predicts the year by training on maps of near-surface temperature. We then utilize layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) to visualize the regional temperature signals that are important for the ANN's prediction in each climate model experiment. To mask noise when extracting only the most robust climate patterns from LRP, we introduce a simple uncertainty metric that can be adopted to other explainable artificial intelligence (AI) problems. We find that the North Atlantic, Southern Ocean, and Southeast Asia are key regions of importance for the neural network to make its prediction, especially prior to the early-21st century. Notably, we also find that the ANN predictions based on maps of observations correlate higher to the actual year after training on the large ensemble experiment with industrial aerosols held fixed to 1920 levels. This work illustrates the sensitivity of regional temperature signals to changes in aerosol forcing in historical simulations. By using explainable AI methods, we have the opportunity to improve our understanding of (non)linear combinations of anthropogenic forcings in state-of-the-art global climate models.","2021-06","2023-09-26 16:12:40","2023-09-26 16:12:40","","","","6","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000666401800010","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;13<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;13<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;111</p>","","","climate change; TRENDS; PROJECTIONS; COMPONENTS; climate forcings; climate models; EARTH SYSTEM MODEL; explainable AI; INSIGHTS; INTERNAL VARIABILITY; large ensembles; neural networks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The attitudes of young people to adult involvement is at times paradoxical in that whilst they were aware of its necessity, adults altered the dynamics of the groups, as there was a ""power gap"" and that adults' views could take precedence. As a result, on some occasions the young people parted ways from the adults. A continual theme from the research was that young people's involvement in ""youth climate groups"" gave them a sense of empowerment and they were much more aware of how to effect change, and to some extent they did need the support of adults in this process, often due to their structural disempowerment. The findings suggest that adult involvement was most successful when adults were committed to empowering young people and the researchers suggest that Kirshner's model of ""cycles of fading"" is a useful framework for adult involvement.","2021-04-23","2023-09-26 16:12:40","2023-09-26 16:12:40","","","","","3","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000995390300001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;53</p>","","","climate change; POWER; activisim; climate activism; climate justice; DRIVEN; empowerment; participation; youth; youth work","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The IP climate is influenced by both the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean sea. Complex interactions with the orography take place there and high-resolution models are required to realistically reproduce its current and future climate. We find that under the RCP8.5 scenario, the generalized 2-m air temperature (T2M) increase by the end of the twenty-first century (2070-2099) in the atmospheric-only simulation is tempered by the coupling. The impact of coupling is specially seen in summer, when the warming is stronger. Precipitation shows regionally-dependent changes in winter, whilst a drier climate is found in summer. The coupling generally reduces the magnitude of the changes. Differences in T2M and precipitation between the coupled and uncoupled simulations are caused by changes in the Atlantic large-scale circulation and in the Mediterranean Sea. Additionally, the differences in projected changes of T2M and precipitation with the RAOCM under the RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 scenarios are tackled. Results show that in winter and summer T2M increases less and precipitation changes are of a smaller magnitude with the RCP4.5. Whilst in summer changes present a similar regional distribution in both runs, in winter there are some differences in the NW of the IP due to differences in the North Atlantic circulation. The differences in the climate change signal from the RAOCM and the driving Global Coupled Model show that regionalization has an effect in terms of higher resolution over the land and ocean.","2021-11","2023-09-26 16:12:40","2023-09-26 16:12:40","","2325-2349","","9-10","57","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000652987900003","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;82</p>","","","Climate change; MODEL; CIRCULATION; Air-sea coupling; CHANGE PROJECTIONS; CHANGE SCENARIO; EURO-CORDEX; Future climate; HIGH-RESOLUTION; Iberian Peninsula; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; OCEAN; Regional climate modeling; SURFACE TEMPERATURE; UPPER BOUNDARY-CONDITION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This warming has underpinned the rapid expansion of the UK viticulture sector and its current focus on growing grape varieties for sparkling wine. Near-term (2021-2040) climate change may condition opportunities for further variety and/or wine style changes. Using the latest high -resolution (5 km) ensemble (x 12) of downscaled climate change models for the UK (UK Climate Projections; UKCP18) under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5, we calculate near-term trends and variability in bioclimatic indices (BCIs). We simulate the projected repetition of the UK's highest yielding season-2018-and use an analogue approach to model the 1999-2018 mean growing season temperatures from Pinot noir producing areas of Champagne (France), Burgundy (France) and Baden (Germany) over the UK during 2021-2040. We also project, across the UK for the 2021-2040 period, BCI values of recent high-quality vintage years from Champagne and Burgundy. GST are projected to increase from a 1999-2018 spatial range of 13.0 (minimum threshold)-15.7 degrees C to a future (2021-2040) range of 13.0-17.0 degrees C, and Growing Degree Days (GDD) from 850 (minimum threshold)-1267 to 850-1515. Growing season precipitation (GSP) is projected to decline in some UK viticulture areas but is not modelled as a limiting viticulture factor. High inter-annual weather variability is simulated to remain a feature of the UK viticulture climate and early season frost risk is likely to occur earlier. Large areas of the UK are projected to have > 50 % of years within the bioclimatic ranges experienced during the 2018 growing season, indicating potential higher yields in the future. The 1999-2018 mean Champagne, Burgundy and Baden GST and GDD are projected for much of England and some areas in the far south and south-east of Wales during 2021- 2040, with significant areas projected to have > 25 % of years within the BCI ranges of top Champagne vintages. These results indicate greater potential for Pinot noir for sparkling wines and shifting suitability to still red wine production. Accounting for changes in variety suitability and wine styles will be essential to maximise opportunities and build resilience within this rapidly expanding wine region.","2022","2023-09-26 16:12:40","2023-09-26 16:12:40","","69-87","","3","56","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000876965200006","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;60</p>","","","climate change; TRENDS; VARIABILITY; MODEL; climate adaptation; climate resilience; PHENOLOGY; bioclimatic indices; FUTURE; INVESTMENT; Pinot noir; SPATIAL-ANALYSIS; viticulture suitability; WINE; WINEGRAPE-GROWING REGIONS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is a weak correlation between increases in vertical resolution and in climate sensitivity from CMIP5. In particular, the MO Hadley Centre GCM's vertical resolution has more than doubled, and its climate sensitivity has also increased substantially. We therefore compare estimates of climate sensitivity from the CMIP6 model HadGEM3-GC3.1-LL, with 85 levels, and a version with 242 levels. This is far higher resolution than in any previously published simulations with a mainstream GCM, though still less than many scales important for clouds. The climate sensitivity and feedbacks, including the cloud feedback, change little. This suggests that vertical resolution did not drive recent increases in GCM climate sensitivity, though this result should be further tested in other GCMs and over a broader range of resolutions.","2021-06-28","2023-09-26 16:12:40","2023-09-26 16:12:40","","","","12","48","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000668622800019","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;30</p>","","","climate change; GCM; ATMOSPHERE; climate feedbacks; climate sensitivity; CLOUDS; general circulation model; SCHEME; vertical resolution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Political decision-makers, climate scientists and practitioners approach this challenge from what are often radically different perspectives and experiences. While considerable work has been done to develop the idea of 'co-production' in the development of climate action outputs, questions remain over how to best unite the contrasting epistemological traditions and norms associated with different stakeholders. Drawing on the existing literatures on climate action co-production and from translational perspectives on the science-policy interface, in this paper we develop the concept of 'boundary agency'. Defining this as the agency 'possessed' when willing and able to translate between different epistemological communities invested in a similar policy and governance challenge such as climate change, we offer it as a useful means to reflect on participants' understanding of the 'co' in co-production. This is in contrast to the more established (often academic-led) focus on what it is that is being produced by co-production processes. We draw from two complementary empirical studies, which explicitly encouraged i) engagement and ii) reflection on cross-boundary co-production between climate action stakeholders from different backgrounds. Reflecting on the two studies, we discuss the benefits of (and barriers to) encouraging more active and sustained engagement between climate action stakeholders so as to try to actively blur the boundaries between science and policy and, in doing so, invent new epistemological communities of practice.","2022-01","2023-09-26 16:12:40","2023-09-26 16:12:40","","","","","72","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000738910700003","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;11<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;11<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;49</p>","","","Climate change; DECISION-MAKING; Boundary agency; Climate action; Climate knowledge; Co-production; Decision making; FOOD-WATER NEXUS; IPCC; KNOWLEDGE COPRODUCTION; ORGANIZATIONS; SERVICES; WORK","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In an analysis of smallholder farming in Zambia, Kenya, and Jamaica, we document low weather forecast use, showing that perceptions of changes in the climate relate to views on forecast accuracy. Drawing on detailed data from Zambia, we show that weather forecast use (or not) is associated with perceptions of the accuracy (or inaccuracy) of the forecast, with rates of weather forecast use far lower among those who believe climate change impacts forecast accuracy. The results suggest a novel feedback whereby climate change erodes confidence in weather forecasts.

To investigate the likelihood of achieving this target, we calculate the year of exceedance of a given global warming threshold (GWT) temperature across 32 CMIP6 models for Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) and radiative forcing combinations included in the Tier 1 ScenarioMIP simulations. Threshold exceedance year calculations reveal that a majority of CMIP6 models project warming beyond 2 degrees C by the end of the century under every scenario or pathway apart from the lowest emission scenarios considered, SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6, which is largely a function of the ScenarioMIP experiment design. The U.K. Earth System Model (UKESM1) ScenarioMIP projections are analyzed in detail to assess the regional and seasonal variations in climate at different warming levels. The warming signal emerging by midcentury is identified as significant and distinct from internal climate variability in all scenarios considered and includes warming summers in the Mediterranean, drying in the Amazon, and heavier Indian monsoons. Arctic sea ice depletion results in prominent amplification of warming and tropical warming patterns emerge that are distinct from interannual variability.

With these regions warming 2-3 times faster than the global average, climate change threatens the long-term viability of these important seasonal transport routes. We examine how climate change will impact the world's busiest heavy-haul winter road-the Tibbitt to Contwoyto Winter Road (TCWR) in northern Canada. The FLake freshwater lake model is used to project ice thickness for a lake at the start of the TCWR-first using observational climate data, and second using modeled future climate scenarios corresponding to varying rates of warming ranging from 1.5 degrees to 4 degrees C above preindustrial temperatures. Our results suggest that 2 degrees C warming could be a tipping point for the viability of the TCWR, requiring at best costly adaptation and at worst alternative forms of transportation. Containing warming to the more ambitious temperature target of 1.5 degrees C pledged at the 2016 Paris Agreement may be the only way to keep the TCWR viable-albeit with a shortened annual operational season relative to present. More widely, we show that higher regional winter warming across much of the rest of Arctic North America threatens the long-term viability of winter roads at a continental scale. This underlines the importance of continued global efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions to avoid many long-term and irreversible impacts of climate change.","2021-07","2023-09-26 16:12:39","2023-09-26 16:12:39","","E1464-E1480","","7","102","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000683897000014","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;65</p>","","","TRENDS; Climate change; IMPACTS; REGION; CALIBRATION; North America; Climate models; Climate prediction; ARCTIC AMPLIFICATION; FIELD; ICE PHENOLOGY; Ice thickness; PATTERNS; Societal impacts; TELECONNECTIONS; TEMPERATURE-CHANGE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recognition of the complexity of climate change compels researchers to draw on interdisciplinary knowledge that marries natural sciences with social sciences and humanities. Yet most interdisciplinary approaches fail to adequately merge the framings of the disparate disciplines, resulting in reductionist messages that are largely devoid of context, and hence provide incomplete and misleading analysis for decision-making. For different knowledge systems to work better together toward climate solutions, we need to reframe the way questions are asked and research pursued, in order to inform action without slipping into reductionism. We suggest that interdisciplinarity needs to be rethought. This will require accepting a plurality of narratives, embracing multiple disciplinary perspectives, and shifting expectations of public messaging, and above all looking to integrate the appropriate disciplines that can help understand human systems in order to better mediate action.","2021-10","2023-09-26 16:12:39","2023-09-26 16:12:39","","","","3-4","168","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000707922600001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;19<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;19<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;58</p>","","","CHALLENGES; SCIENCE; KNOWLEDGE; WORK; Climate change research; Climate solutions; Interdisciplinarity; POLICY; QUESTION; Reductionism; Social science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, robust aspects of the thermodynamics can be used to constrain some dynamical aspects. This paper argues that tropospheric expansion under global warming (a thermodynamical process) explains changes in the amplitude of the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) in the lower and middle stratosphere (a dynamical process). A theoretical scaling for tropospheric expansion of approximately 6 hPa K-1 is derived, which agrees well with global climate model (GCM) experiments. Using this theoretical scaling, the response of QBO amplitude to global warming is predicted by shifting the climatological QBO amplitude profile upward by 6 hPa per kelvin of global warming. In global warming simulations, QBO amplitude in the lower to middle stratosphere shifts upward as predicted by tropospheric expansion. Applied to observations, the tropospheric expansion framework suggests a historical weakening of QBO amplitude at 70 hPa of 3% decade(-1) from 1953 to 2020. This expected weakening trend is half of the 6% decade(-1) from 1953 to 2012 detected and attributed to global warming in a recent study. The previously reported trend was reinforced by record low QBO amplitudes during the mid-2000s, from which the QBO has since recovered. Given the modest weakening expected on physical grounds, past decadal modulations of QBO amplitude are reinterpreted as a hitherto unrecognized source of internal variability. This large internal variability dominates over the global warming signal such that, despite 65 years of observations, there is not yet a statistically significant weakening trend.","2021-12","2023-09-26 16:12:39","2023-09-26 16:12:39","","9823-9836","","24","34","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000752652100015","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;39</p>","","","TEMPERATURE; Climate change; CLIMATE-CHANGE; Climate models; BREWER-DOBSON CIRCULATION; Internal variability; QUASI-BIENNIAL OSCILLATION; Quasibiennial oscillation; Tropopause","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is quite complex and difficult to quantify the consequences of climate change on railway infrastructure because of the inherent nature of the railway itself. Hence, the main aim of this work is to qualitatively identify and assess the impact of climate change on railway infrastructure with associated risks and consequences. A qualitative research methodology is employed in the study using a questionnaire as a tool for information gathering from experts from several municipalities in Sweden, Swedish transport infrastructure managers, maintenance organizations, and train operators. The outcome of this questionnaire revealed that there was a lower level of awareness about the impact of climate change on the various facets of railway infrastructure.

Based on occurrence records, national meteorological data and the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model (a species distribution model), we investigated for the first time the interdecadal variations in climate-suitable areas of cotton with changing climate in China from 1961 to 2017. Then, the gravity center and concentration index were employed to investigate the spatial-temporal variations of cotton production. The results revealed the dominant meteorological predictors affecting climate suitability of cotton to be > 28 degrees C accumulated maximum temperature from April to October, average temperature in the warmest month, continuous days with daily average temperature >15 degrees C and annual precipitation days. The climate optimum areas were generally distributed in the eastern and northern parts of the Huanghe Valley and Northwest Inland cotton regions, respectively. The climatic suitability of cotton has increased in China in recent decades. In particular, the areas of improved climatic suitability of cotton encompassed 38.08 % of the whole country from the 1960s to 2010s. This increase was concentrated in the Huanghe Valley and Northwest Inland cotton regions. The distribution of climate-suitable areas moved northward and expanded westward. Meanwhile, the gravity center of the cotton production moved to the northwest at a distance of approximately 1283 km from 1985 to 2015. Although both the production and distribution of climate-suitable areas of cotton shifted towards the northwest, the proportions of inconsistency between planting areas and climate-suitable areas increased from 22.76 % in the 1980s to 32.38 % in the 2010s. The increasing planting acreage in areas of low climate suitability may pose a risk to cotton production, especially in emerging major planting areas of the Northwest Inland cotton region. The results of the present study can provide a theoretical reference for the optimization of planting distribution and ensure the sustainable production of the cotton industry.","2021-11-01","2023-09-26 16:12:39","2023-09-26 16:12:39","","","","","171","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000696629300005","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;8<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;8<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;80</p>","","","ADAPTATION; TEMPERATURE; Climate change; CHALLENGES; UNCERTAINTY; STRESS; Climate-suitable area; MaxEnt model; Potential distribution; PREDICTION; SPATIOTEMPORAL CHANGES; SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS; XINJIANG; YIELD","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We investigated for the first time the potential impact of climate change on potato distribution at a national scale. The interdecadal change of potato distribution in China in response to the climate change from 1961 to 2017 was estimated using the MaxEnt model. The annual precipitation, annual average minimum temperature, average temperature in the coldest month, and sunshine duration were selected to model the climate suitability of potato distribution. The climate optimum areas exhibited a shrinking trend, with proportion of acreage falling from 5.12 % in the 1960s to 3.49 % in the 2010s. Climate suitable areas showed the tendency to expand to the east and shrink to the north. As an illustration, the climate suitability in eastern part of North-central Region was increased, but was decreased in southern part of Southwest Region. The proportions of consistency between major planting areas and high climate suitability areas were decreased from 93.36 % in the 1980s to 79.62 % in the 2010s. The increase of potato acreage in low climate suitable areas such as Middle and Lower Reaches of Yangtze River Region, Southeast Region, and southern part of Southwest Region might bring an adverse effect to potato production. Given that the climate optimum areas were found in the marginal regions of mid-western Xinjiang province in the past 60 years, it might be potential areas for potato introduction. The evaluation of climate suitability could provide a theoretical reference for planting layout of potato, which was conducive to reducing the potential risk of climate change on potato production and developing a reasonable regionalization of climate suitability.","2021-04-15","2023-09-26 16:12:39","2023-09-26 16:12:39","","","","","310","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000615985000014","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;20<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;20<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;89</p>","","","Climate change; WATER-USE EFFICIENCY; MaxEnt model; SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS; YIELD; AGROPASTORAL ECOTONE; Climate suitability; GLOBAL DISTRIBUTION; Planting acreage; PLANTING DATE; Potato; RADIATION USE EFFICIENCY; SUITABLE AREAS; SUPPLEMENTAL IRRIGATION; WINTER-WHEAT","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Three pronounced reference peaks found in Reference Publication Year Spectroscopy (RYPS) represent the most significant papers associated with the yield, quality, and climate suitability for tea. Tea yield increases with elevated CO2 levels, but this increment could be substantially affected by an increasing temperature. Other climatic factors are uneven rainfall, extreme weather events, and climate-driven abiotic stressors. An altered climate presents both advantages and disadvantages for tea quality due to the uncertainty of the concentrations of biochemicals in tea leaves. Climate change creates losses, gains, and shifts of climate suitability for tea habitats. Further studies are required in order to fill the knowledge gaps identified through the present review, such as an investigation of the interaction between the tea plant and multiple environmental factors that mimic real-world conditions and then studies on its impact on the tea system, as well as the design of ensemble modeling approaches to predict climate suitability for tea. Finally, we outline multifaceted and evidence-based adaptive and mitigation strategies that can be implemented in tea fields to alleviate the undesirable impacts of climate change.","2021-04","2023-09-26 16:12:39","2023-09-26 16:12:39","","","","4","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000642653000001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;10<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;10<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;122</p>","","","climate change; yield; DROUGHT STRESS; ELEVATED CO2; PREDICTION; BIOSYNTHESIS; climate suitability; climatic factors; CULTIVATION; ENVIRONMENT; GREEN TEA; GROWTH; METABOLITES; POLYPHENOLS; quality; tea","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, a systematic review with the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analyses (PRISMA) protocol was conducted to identify, classify, and investigate existing climate-adaptive measures for housing on the basis of 65 articles selected. In total, 21 climate-adaptive measures were identified and classified into three categories, namely, passive design, building technology, and building performance assessment tools. From the identified climate-adaptive measures, 16 distinct benefits were identified, the majority of which are related to improved thermal comfort and energy efficiency.

In some locations, warmer temperatures may offer opportunities to grow novel, high value crops, but non-climatic factors also inform agricultural decision-making. These non-climatic factors can be difficult to quantify and incorporate into suitability assessments, particularly for uncertain futures. Objective: To demonstrate how qualitative and quantitative techniques can be combined to assess crop suitability with consideration for climatic and non-climatic factors. Methods: We carried out a horizon scanning exercise that used Delphi methodology to identify possible novel crops for a region in south-west England. We show how the results of the expert panel assessment could be combined with a crop suitability model that only considered climate to identify the best crops to grow in the region. Results and conclusions: Whilst improving climate and crop models will enhance the ability to identify environmental constraints to growing novel crops, we propose horizon scanning as a useful tool to understand constraints on crop suitability that are beyond the parameterisation of these models and that may affect agricultural decisions. Significance: A similar combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches to assessing crop suitability could be used to identify potential novel crops in other regions and to support more holistic assessments of crop suitability in a changing world.","2021-05","2023-09-26 16:12:39","2023-09-26 16:12:39","","","","","190","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000647657100006","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;74</p>","","","climate change; BIODIVERSITY; LAND-USE; CHANGE IMPACTS; Adaptation; FOOD; FUTURE; WINE; agriculture; climate suitability; AGRICULTURE; Delphi; DELPHI METHOD; HEMP; INTEGRATED ASSESSMENT; novel crops","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using a multi-criteria decision making technique, models have been ranked based on 25 metrics which compare their performances with observation data. Results indicate a better representation of annual rainfall cycles as well as spatial pattern by CMIP6 models compared to CMIP5. Though majority of the models from both CMIPs show late onset and early retreat of the rainy season, CMIP6 GCMs simulate the onset, retreat, and the length of the rainy season closer to the observation. Large-scale circulation patterns evaluated using spatial correlation and root mean square error (RMSE) show improvements in CMIP6 across all metrics, especially for the moisture flux convergence. Performances for large-scale circulation are generally reflected in rainfall simulation; however, few models showed that better simulations of rainfall do not exclusively depend on their performance for large-scale variables. Overall, CMIP6 models are found to be superior to CMIP5 models in simulating rainfall and large-scale circulation, which is likely attributable to CMIP6 model's higher spatial resolutions, increased number of vertical levels, improved atmospheric and land surface parameterization, etc. Finally, subsets of optimal models from CMIP5 and CMIP6 that proved to be better at representing the summer monsoons in the study area are identified. These models are recommended to develop robust future projections that can be used for climate change impact and adaptation studies.","2022-02","2023-09-26 16:12:39","2023-09-26 16:12:39","","1181-1202","","2","42","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000678189300001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;24<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;24<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;69</p>","","","climate change; VARIABILITY; PRECIPITATION; UNCERTAINTY; CIRCULATION; model evaluation; CHANGE PROJECTIONS; CHANGE IMPACT; climate model; MAXIMUM TEMPERATURE; MINIMUM TEMPERATURE; ONSET; SELECTION; Southeast Asian monsoon","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design/methodology/approach This study takes an interpretivist stance. Research into archive and record management literature was conducted to establish key themes on climate change within the information sector. These themes informed research questions included in a survey cascaded to UK archivists, conservators, records managers and cultural heritage professionals via national mailing lists. The results were then codified and analysed. The study had research ethics and data protection approval from University College London. Findings Using professional ethics as a framework, this paper argues that climate action can protect records from the impact of climate change, ensuring future access. The information professionals surveyed were motivated by duties to preservation and access to mitigate the impact of the information sector on the environment. However, sector-specific climate action, such as introducing passive storage conditions or decreasing collection sizes, is limited by insufficient resources, organisational hierarchies and cultures, sector support and a perceived conflict with the duty to preservation. Originality/value To date, there is a growing body of literature from other countries on archival practices and the natural environment.

The purpose of this study is to assess the perception of farmers to climate change, adaptation strategies and determinants of adaptation choice in central Ethiopia. Design/methodology/approach The study used data from randomly selected 240 farm households. Descriptive statistics were used to describe farmers' perceptions of climate change and adaptation strategies. Also, a multivariate probit model was used to identify the major factors affecting farmers' choice of adaptation strategies to climate change in central Ethiopia. Findings Smallholder farmers perceive climate change in the past two decades in response; the majority (91.47%) of farmers used adaptation options. Improved crop varieties and input intensity, crop diversification, planting date adjustment, soil and water conservation activities and changing of the crop type were used as adaptation options in the study area. A few of these strategies were significantly confirmed a complementary and supplementary relationship. The study identified sex, family size, agroecology, climate information, crop-fail history and formal extension service as significant determinants for farmers' adaptation choices as these variables significantly affected more than two farmers' adaptation strategies simultaneously. Research limitations/implications Farmers' choice of adaptation was highly constrained by institutional factors and all these identified factors can be possibly addressed through a better institutional service provision system. It is, therefore, recommended that local administrators should explore the institutional service provision system for a better farm-level adaptation while considering demographic characteristics as well.

The future potential changes in the SASM have great importance for climate change adaption and policy setting in this populous region. To understand the SASM changes and their link with the global warming of 1.5 degrees-5 degrees C above the preindustrial level, we investigate the changes in the SASM circulation and precipitation based on a large-ensemble simulation conducted with Canadian Earth System Model version 2 (CanESM2). With the global mean surface temperature (GMST) increase, the large-ensemble mean of SASM circulation is projected to weaken almost linearly while the precipitation and precipitable water are projected to enhance quasi-linearly. A double anticyclone along the tropical Indian Ocean is a major anomalous circulation pattern for each additional degree of warming and is responsible for the weakening of the lower-level westerlies. The decreased upper-level land-sea thermal contrast (TCupper) is the main thermal driver for the weakening of the SASM circulation while the lower-level thermal contrast contributes little. The nonlinearly decreased TCupper is mainly related to the temperature response to the increased CO2 forcing and convection-induced latent heat release in the tropics. The increase in the SASM precipitation is mainly due to the quasi-linearly increased positive contribution of the thermodynamic component, while the dynamic component has a negative impact. Both horizontal moisture advection and moisture convergence contribute to the precipitation increase, and moisture convergence plays a dominant role. These results provide new insight that the SASM changes can be roughly scaled by the GMST changes.","2021-10","2023-09-26 16:12:38","2023-09-26 16:12:38","","7913-7926","","19","34","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000752634100009","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;7<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;7<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;75</p>","","","Climate change; PRECIPITATION; CLIMATE; CIRCULATION; Climate prediction; AUSTRALIAN MONSOON; FUTURE CHANGES; HYDROLOGICAL CYCLE; LARGE ENSEMBLES; MECHANISMS; Monsoons; Precipitation; RAINFALL VARIABILITY; RELATIVE ROLES; Water budget/balance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A reality check from Nepal","SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT","","0048-9697","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.143509","","Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) are the foundation of the Paris Agreement. So far, 190 Parties have submitted their NDCs. But how the NDC can be made comprehensive, unanimous and implementable so that the Paris climate goals can be achieved has been a matter of growing concern among policymakers, academics, and practitioners. Aiming to bridge the knowledge gap about institutional deliberation of NDCs, we assessed the formulation process and implementation outcome of Nepal's first NDC by employing qualitative research methods. We undertook semi-structured interviews (n = 10) with all experts and bureaucrats engaged in the NDC formulation process. Moreover, we conducted group discussions (n = 18) with nine stakeholder groups and key informant surveys (n = 12) with four stakeholder groups representing cross-sectoral ministries, private-sector, (retired) bureaucrats, and media people. We also reviewed contemporary literature and progress report of sectoral governments and other related institutions. The collected data were then analyzed by applying the discursive institutional framework. As NDC is a national political plan of climate action and demands support and commitment from a wide spectrum of society, our results, however, revealed that Nepal's first NDC was formulated without engaging politicians and the other major state and non-state actors. Moreover, the country's NDC was framed and articulated only for fulfilling international obligation (or commitment) and getting international fund, but not as a determined national climate plan of action for expediting climate action at (sub) national level. Our analysis further found that very few institutions including policies, programmes, and budgets were arranged for translating targets of the NDC into action. Because of these shortcomings, Nepal's first NDC could not achieve most of its stipulated targets. Based on the analysis and results of our study, we have discussed and recommended some pathways that are critical for the formulation and implementation of enhanced/updated NDCs in Nepal and the other countries.

In future, projected changes to the frequency and/or intensity of extreme weather events could change weather-infrastructure risk profiles. Infrastructure owners and operators need to manage current weather impacts and put in place adequate plans to anticipate and adapt to changes in future weather risks, or mitigate the impacts arising from those risks. The assessment of the risk posed to railway infrastructure from current and future weather is dependent on a good understanding of the constituent components of risk: hazard, vulnerability, and exposure. A good understanding of the baseline and projected future risk is needed in order to understand the potential benefits of various climate change adaptation actions. Traditional risk assessment methods need some modification in order to be applied to climate change timescales, for which decisions need to be made under deep uncertainty. This review paper highlights some key challenges for assessing the risk, including: managing uncertainties; understanding weather-impact relationships and how they could change with climate change; assessing the costs of current and future weather impacts and the potential cost versus benefit of adaptation; and understanding practices and tools for adapting railway infrastructure. The literature reveals examples of progress and good practice in all these areas, providing scope for effective knowledge-sharing-across the railway infrastructure and other sectors-in support of infrastructure resilience and adaptation.

Here, a VM based on General Additive Model (GAM) methods evaluated the empirical relationships between coral cover (n = 905 sites pooled to 318 reef cells of the Western and Central Indian Ocean Provinces) and 15 potentially influential variables. Six environmental and one fisheries management variables were selected as significant including SST shape distributions, dissolved oxygen, calcite, and fisheries management. Common predictive variables, including cumulative degree-heating weeks (DHW), pH, maximum light, SST bimodality and rate of rise, and two multivariate metrics were either weak or not significant predictors of coral cover. A spatially-resolved 2020 baseline for future predictions of coral cover within 11,678 reef similar to 6.25 km(2) cells within 13 ecoregions and 4 fisheries management categories using the 7 top VM variables was established for comparing VM and TM coral cover prediction for the year 2050. We compared the two model's predictions for high and low Relative Concentration Pathway (CMIP5; RCP8.5 and 2.6) scenarios using the four available future-cast SST variables. The excess heat (DHW)-coral mortality relationship of the TM predicted considerably lower coral cover in 2050 than the VM. For example, for the RCP8.5 and RCP2.6 scenarios, the decline in coral for the TM predicted was 81 and 58% compared to a 29 and 20% for the VM among reef cells with >25% coral cover in 2020, if a proposed optimal fisheries management was achieved. Despite differences, coral cover predictions for the VM and TM overlapped in two environmental regions located in the southern equatorial current region of the Indian Ocean. Historical and future patterns of acute and chronic stresses are expected to be more influential than cumulative heat stress in predicting coral cover, which is better accounted for by the VM than the TM.","2021-12-02","2023-09-26 16:12:38","2023-09-26 16:12:38","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000730727300001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;68</p>","","","climate change; IMPACT; RESPONSES; RESILIENCE; MORTALITY; DRIVEN; climate model; coral reef; fisheries; future prediction; RATES; TEMPERATURE VARIABILITY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, the regional coupled model AVIM-RIEMS2.0 with dynamic vegetation process is employed to examine the impacts of LULCC on regional climate over East Asia. The results show that regional climate and terrestrial surface processes exhibit significantly seasonal and interdecadal signals in East Asia. With the influences of LULCC, forest increased 33.3% and 20.3% from the 1980s to 1990s and from the 1990s to 2000s, respectively. Meanwhile, cropland decreased 17.8% in the 1990s (compared to the 1980s) and 24.8% in the 2000s (compared to the 1990s), respectively. These transitions of land surface processes are roughly coincident with the interdecadal variations in temperature and precipitation, which trigger generally opposite changes in the 1980s as compared to the 1990s, especially over eastern China. The seasonal variability of climatic components is more evident in winter than summer, except for the precipitation. The climate change is also somewhat remarkable under the non-LULCC conditions, combined with the changes in wind fields at the 850 hPa from the simulations during three decades; they together suggest that climate change is also modulated by other controlling factors, such as East Asian monsoon circulations in addition to LULCC conversions. These results highlight the importance of LULCC in regional modeling studies, which would have practical significance in climate mitigation and adaptation over East Asia.","2021-07","2023-09-26 16:12:38","2023-09-26 16:12:38","","549-565","","1-2","145","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000650120500003","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;69</p>","","","TEMPERATURE; RIVER-BASIN; Climate change; PRECIPITATION; SIMULATIONS; SYSTEM; ATTRIBUTION; ATMOSPHERE; WEATHER; 0; AVIM-RIEMS2; CHINA; Land use and land cover change; MONSOON; Regional climate simulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"HK2KV8TN","journalArticle","2021","Feng, XF; Wu, LG","The Contribution of Internal Variability to Asian Midlatitude Warming","JOURNAL OF CLIMATE","","0894-8755","10.1175/JCLI-D-20-0231.1","","The tropospheric warming in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) midlatitudes has been an important factor in regulating weather and climate since the twentieth century. Apart from anthropogenic forcing leading to the midlatitude warming, this study investigates the possible contribution of internal variability to Asian midlatitude warming and its role in East Asian circulation changes in boreal summer, using four reanalysis datasets in the past century and a set of 1800-yr preindustrial control simulations of the Community Earth System Model version 1 large ensemble (CESM-LE). The surface and tropospheric warming in the Asian midlatitudes is associated with a strong upper-level geopotential height rise north of the Tibetan Plateau (TP). Linear trends of 200-hPa geopotential height (Z200) confirm a dipole of an anomalous high north of the TP and an anomalous low over the Iranian Plateau in 1958-2017. The leading internal circulation mode bears a striking resemblance to the Z200 trend in the past 60 and 111 years, indicating that the long-term trend may be partially of internal origin. The Asian midlatitude warming is also found in preindustrial simulations of CESM-LE, further suggesting that internal variability explains at least part of the temperature change in the Asian midlatitudes, which is in a chain of wave trains along the NH midlatitudes. The Asian warming decreases the meridional gradient of geopotential height, resulting in the weakening of westerly winds over the TP and the TP thermal forcing. Thus, it is essential to consider the role of internal variability in shaping East Asian surface temperature and East Asian summer monsoon changes in the past decades.","2021-04","2023-09-26 16:12:38","2023-09-26 16:12:38","","2429-2439","","7","34","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000644142700003","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;49</p>","","","Climate change; PRECIPITATION; TIBETAN PLATEAU; Climate models; CHINA; Asia; ATLANTIC MULTIDECADAL OSCILLATION; Atmospheric circulation; DECADAL VARIATION; HEAT-SOURCE; Multidecadal variability; PART I; REANALYSIS; SUMMER MONSOON; SURFACE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on the research and practice on climate change adaptation worldwide, this paper constructs an evaluation indicator system for climate-resilient cities with six primary indicators and 15-21 secondary indicators to assess the progress of the pilot program in a comprehensive manner. The study shows that the consciousness of climate adaptation has been strengthened, their adaptive capacity has been improved, and their climate change monitoring capacity and the basic adaptive capacity have been enhanced. Meanwhile, each pilot city has carried out unique system and mechanism innovation and international cooperation and exchange activities, but the progress is uneven, and there is still room for improvement in the overall adaptive capacity. It is recommended that a system for evaluating the progress of the climate-resilient city pilots be established as soon as possible, and that the review of the adaptation actions and highlights of the city pilots be strengthened, so as to raise the political status of the pilot areas and strengthen their consciousness of climate change adaptation.","2021-03","2023-09-26 16:12:38","2023-09-26 16:12:38","","","","01","09","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000659529400006","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;14</p>","","","climate change adaptation; CAPACITY; Climate-resilient city; evaluation indicator system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We begin with the relationship between woody dicot leaf margins and temperature, and trace the development of the approach through to the modern multivariate tool known as Climate-Leaf Analysis Multivariate Program (CLAMP), which can derive 24 different climate parameters from 31 macroscopic leaf traits commonly preserved in leaf fossils. We review the complex inter-dependant correlations between leaf traits and climate, recognising that leaves develop and function as integrated systems, and that there is a selective premium on them being well adapted to their immediate climatic environment. We discuss different ways of understanding and decoding climate from leaf form in multidimensional trait space, and provide an over-view of CLAMP applications for tracking climate change, monsoon evolution, and in palaeoaltimetry, from the middle Cretaceous to the Pleistocene.","2021-01-15","2023-09-26 16:12:38","2023-09-26 16:12:38","","","","","562","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000604584600053","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;24<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;24<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;174</p>","","","Climate change; CLAMP; Climate modelling; CLIMATIC PARAMETERS; COEXISTENCE APPROACH; Foliar physiognomy; Fossil leaves; FOSSIL LEAVES; MARGIN ANALYSIS; PALEOBOTANICAL EVIDENCE; PALEOPRECIPITATION INDICATORS; PHENOTYPIC INTEGRATION; PLANT-COMMUNITIES; PLATANUS-ACERIFOLIA PLATANACEAE; SOUTH ASIAN MONSOON","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For this reason, the climatic zones of 7967 peninsular cities have been updated and adapted to the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios by using the data measured in 77 meteorological reference stations. The results obtained have shown that in more than 80% of the cities, buildings are designed and constructed according to an obsolete climatic classification that does not take into account the current or future climatic reality, which will significantly affect the thermal performance of a building and highlights the need to review the climatic zoning in the country.

It is also an emotional encounter that may have enduring effects. To date, little research has attended to the emotional significance of childhood learning experiences of climate change in adult lives and in social responses to climate change. We report a qualitative study exploring the variety, complexity, and the post-school significance of affective experiences of climate change schooling. We interviewed 21 young adults (18-24 years) in Tasmania, Australia, with diverse educational backgrounds and diverse levels of interest in and opinions about climate change. Applying an interpretivist framework, we analysed the tangled and interrelated emotions evident in participant reflections on educational encounters with climate change. Three overarching themes were identified: 'stripped of power', 'stranded by the generation gap' and 'daunted by the future'. In contrast to discourses of education as empowering, a majority of participants (n = 16) told of feeling disempowered by their educational encounters with climate change. They described being overwhelmed by an experience of limited agency and power. Participants also identified a generational gap that left them feeling abandoned by older adults, with associated feelings of anger and betrayal. Finally, affective experience of climate change schooling had ongoing significance for participants as they sought to make life choices in the shadow of a frightening future. These findings provide insight into the interaction of facts and feelings in public engagements with climate change. A lack of integration of cognitive and affective experience in climate change schooling may have lasting effects in adult attitudes and behaviours, and related social dynamics of distrust and division, related to this issue. In this study, young adult participants recounted childhood experiences of being powerless, betrayed and afraid in learning about climate change as significant formative encounters in their ongoing understanding of climate change.","2021-01","2023-09-26 16:11:53","2023-09-26 16:11:53","","190-200","","","118","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000610788300019","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;42<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;42<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;102</p>","","","Climate change; COMMUNICATION; ENGAGEMENT; WORK; Climate change education; Education; Affect; Emotion; HOPE; KNOWLEDGES; Social response; TEACHERS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, stationary LCZ maps are insufficient for forecasts in the rapidly urbanizing regions, where there are frequent transitions among multiple urban lands and thus changing surface properties. To facilitate climate forecasts with these changing properties, we propose a new methodological framework to predict future LCZ maps using the Cellular Automata (CA) landcover/land-use change (LCLUC) model. Different from most existing LCLUC studies that treat the urban area as homogeneous, our work is the first attempt to simulate the complex conversions among low-, mid-and high-rise urban lands defined in LCZ. To validate our method, we apply it in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) metropolitan area, China, a rapidly urbanizing region with more than 50 million residents. First, we use the World Urban Database and Portal Tool (WUDAPT) method to generate LCZ maps of the PRD region in 2009 and 2014, with satellite images. Then, we apply the CA model on the 2009 LCZ map to forecast 2014 one based on the LCLUC rules discovered by the data mining technique. The comparison between the forecasted and observed 2014 LCZ maps yields a kappa coefficient of 0.77 and an overall accuracy of 82%. Our method achieves satisfactory accuracies on the high-(84%) and low-rise (82%) urban lands while performing relatively poorly on the mid-rise (40%) lands. Our results demonstrate that the combination of the LCZ scheme and LCLUC modeling has the potential of capturing the structural changes within cities and providing the necessary input datasets for urban climate forecasts.","2021-03","2023-09-26 16:11:53","2023-09-26 16:11:53","","","","","36","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000632735300002","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;39</p>","","","Climate change; land-use change; Land-cover; Local climate zone","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The global demand for high-quality food made of durum wheat has been increasing, which poses a challenge in the face of climate change. Major share of durum wheat production is currently located in semi-arid climates, where the risk of climate extremes such as drought and heat stress will likely substantially increase in the future. To provide a first estimate of future global arable land climatically suitable for growing durum wheat, we develop a suitability model based on support vector machines. The current total share of global arable land climatically suitable to grow rainfed durum wheat is around 13%. Climate change may decrease the suitable area by 19% at mid-century and by 48% at the end of the century. Widespread loss of suitable areas is foreseen in the Mediterranean regions and northern America. On the other hand, climate may become suitable to grow durum wheat in many regions of central and western Europe, while the largest gain in suitability is estimated in some parts of Russia. The overall net loss of suitable areas requires the development and the future adoption of effective and sustainable strategies to stabilize production and adapt the entire food supply chain. Our study also clearly demonstrates the importance of limiting global warming to levels well below 2 degrees C at the end of the century, which would substantially limit the loss of climatically suitable areas.","2021-10","2023-09-26 16:11:53","2023-09-26 16:11:53","","","","10","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000708654200001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;13<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;14<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;63</p>","","","climate change; DROUGHT; SIMULATION; PHENOLOGY; YIELD; climate suitability; ENVIRONMENT; climate risk; CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS; durum wheat; LANDRACES","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the first stage, in order to understand the relationship between climate change adaptation and spatial planning the indicators by which spatial planning of adaptation to climate change can be evaluated were examined. The prominent issues for spatial adaptation to climate change have been identified as including spatial adaptation policies, governance model, implementation level, participation and the role of technology. In the second stage, literature was reviewed again on the prominent issues and the smart governance was obtained in it. Then, the scope of the smart governance approach in spatial adaptation to climate change in Turkey was discussed through spatial planning principles, participation, local level and technology. The ""content analysis"" method, which allows descriptive evaluations over the literature, was used as a research method. As a result, spatial planning principles and relevant actors were identified at the local level, but some deficiencies in the use of technology were determined.

As water becomes scarcer, water-related tensions are imminent on different scales. It is the interplay of these tensions with a number of socioeconomic, political, environmental and cultural factors that determine the probability of conflict. Lamu found in the coastal part of Kenya, is a unique location in that access to water is already a major challenge. Combined with the negative impacts of climate change, and the on-going large infrastructural development in the region, Lamu is on the verge of a water crisis. As such, there is a need for research into the context specific factors that play a part in heightening the potential for water-related conflict amidst increasing water scarcity. The focus of this study was to identify and evaluate the context-specific factors that will amplify the potential for water-related conflict in Lamu. The findings suggest religion, migration, and poverty are factors that would heighten the potential for water-related conflict in the region amidst increasing water scarcity. The study recommends that these factors need to be addressed urgently and should be part of any water management mechanism in Lamu, in order to avoid water-related conflicts. Additionally, the findings imply that anticipating the stressors for water-related conflict in Lamu, will play a significant role in managing conflict and facilitating negotiations over the region's water resources.","2022-02","2023-09-26 16:11:53","2023-09-26 16:11:53","","1983-1994","","2","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000695586400001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;58</p>","","","climate change; water; CHALLENGES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MANAGEMENT; VULNERABILITY; climate change adaptation; conflict; FRESH-WATER; GOVERNANCE; Kenya; Lamu; LAPSSET; RESOURCES; SECURITY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The second goal is to investigate whether Polish cities use urban gardening to strengthen the resilience of socio-economic systems to climate change. Based on literature studies, experiences and contemporary trends in urban gardening in different countries were presented as a key factor for improving the resilience of cities. Some initia-tives and projects were described based on dedicated websites.

This article identifies three stages of climate institutions in Brazil, a major emitter of greenhouse gases through deforestation that managed to reduce such emissions for nearly a decade. It shows that a narrow definition of climate institutions that seeks purpose-built state institutions fails to capture important dynamics there, and that such institutions have little direct impact on outcomes. In Brazil's political landscape, national presidents exercise a decisive influence on their climate ambitions and capacities. However, positive and negative feedback loops also brought some effective climate action from the layering of climate purposes into existing institutions, as well as through non-traditional institutions like private governance arrangements for agriculture.","2021-10-20","2023-09-26 16:11:53","2023-09-26 16:11:53","","49-70","","","30","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000675281700001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;13<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;13<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;53</p>","","","Climate change; Brazil; deforestation; POLICY; POLITICS; AMAZON DEFORESTATION; climate institutions; DEFORESTATION SLOWDOWN; FOREST CODE; HISTORICAL INSTITUTIONALISM; SOY; STATE; TRANSITIONS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We argue that climate change literacy (i.e., knowledge about climate change) is a major determinant of why some individuals consider migrating to other countries in response to climate change effects. In particular, climate change literacy helps individuals translate their perceptions of temperature changes into an understanding of these changes' irreversible long-term consequences. We test this hypothesis using highly accurate geo-coded data for 37,000 individuals across 30 African countries. We show that climate change indeed leads to stronger migration intentions among climate literates only. Furthermore, we show that climate change only increases migration intentions among climate literates when it is approximated by long-run increases in local temperatures, but not when operationalized as changing heat wave or precipitation patterns. Further analyses show that climate literates are more likely to live in urban areas, have a higher news consumption, are highly educated, and have demanding occupations. Consequently, climate change may further deprive affected countries of valuable talent.","2021-11","2023-09-26 16:11:53","2023-09-26 16:11:53","","","","1-2","169","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000715024800001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;46</p>","","","TEMPERATURE; VARIABILITY; Climate change; DETERMINANTS; IMPACTS; Africa; Climate change literacy; CONFLICT; ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE; INTENTIONS; International migration; INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION; Migration intentions; PERCEPTIONS; POLITICAL KNOWLEDGE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moreover, these areas are often densely populated, with agriculture-based livelihoods sensitive to transient climate extremes not always included in available climate projections. In this context, we present an analysis of observed and projected trends in temperature and precipitation extremes across agroecosystems (AESs) in the northwest Ethiopian Highlands, to provide more relevant information for adaptation. Limited observational networks are supplemented with a satellite-station hybrid product, and trends are calculated locally and summarized at the adaptation-relevant unit of the AES. Projections are then presented from GCM realizations with divergent climate projections, and results are interpreted in the context of agricultural climate sensitivities. Trends in temperature extremes (1981-2016) are typically consistent across sites and AES, but with different implications for agricultural activities in the other AES. Trends in temperature extremes from GCM projected data also generally have the same sign as the observed trends. For precipitation extremes, there is greater site-to-site variability. Summarized by AES, however, there is a clear tendency towards reduced precipitation, associated with decreases in wet extremes and a tendency towards temporally clustered wet and dry days. Over the retrospective analysis period, neither of the two analysed GCMs captures these trends. Future projections from both GCMs include significant wetting and an increase in precipitation extremes across AES. However, given the lack of agreement between GCMs and observations with respect to trends in recent decades, the reliability of these projections is questionable. The present study is consistent with the ""East Africa Paradox"" that observations show drying in summer season rainfall while GCMs project wetting. This has an expression in summertime Ethiopian rain that has not received significant attention in previous studies.","2022-03-30","2023-09-26 16:11:53","2023-09-26 16:11:53","","2493-2513","","4","42","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000706543800001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;71</p>","","","climate change; RAINFALL; VARIABILITY; DROUGHT; IMPACTS; RESILIENCE; agriculture; climate extremes; climate; agroecosystem; BLUE NILE/ABAY HIGHLANDS; Ethiopia; EVENTS; INDEXES; PRECIPITATION EXTREMES; TEMPERATURE EXTREMES","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, these results were obtained by approximating the equilibrium climate using transient simulations with steadily warming. This approach was recently criticised due to the warmer global land temperature and higher mean precipitation intensities of the transient climate in comparison with the equilibrium climate. Therefore, it is unclear whether floods and droughts projected under a transient climate can be systematically substituted for those occurring in an equilibrated climate. Here, by employing a large ensemble of global hydrological models (HMs) forced by global climate models, we assess the validity of estimating flood and drought characteristics under equilibrium climates from transient simulations. Differences in flood characteristics under transient and equilibrium climates could be largely ascribed to natural variability, indicating that the floods derived from a transient climate reasonably approximate the floods expected in an equally warm, equilibrated climate. By contrast, significant differences in drought intensity between transient and equilibrium climates were detected over a larger global land area than expected from natural variability. Despite the large differences among HMs in representing the low streamflow regime, we found that the drought intensities occurring under a transient climate may not validly represent the intensities in an equally warm equilibrated climate for approximately 6.7% of the global land area.","2021-10","2023-09-26 16:11:52","2023-09-26 16:11:52","","","","10","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000704147200001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;49</p>","","","climate change; STREAMFLOW; RIVER; IMPACTS; 1.5 DEGREES-C; droughts; equilibrium climate; FIELD SIGNIFICANCE; floods; GRADUAL CHANGES; HYDROLOGICAL MODELS; LAND-SURFACE MODEL; OCEAN-ATMOSPHERE MODEL; transient climate; WATER","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The semiarid conditions of the region and tight coupling of livelihood enterprises with ecosystem services creates a situation of increased sensitivity to climate changes and enhanced vulnerability among the rural communities and Native American nations across the region. Recent climate conditions associated with warming trends, and altered atmospheric flows have resulted in rapid onset of drought conditions and other extreme weather events across the region that are changing seasonal patterns of temperature and precipitation and warming trends. Projected climate changes provided in the fourth US National Climate Assessment indicate that potential warming and variability of precipitation will further increase drought and extreme weather events. Recent research and assessment efforts of current and projected climate changes in the Great Plains indicate that rural communities and ecosystems are becoming more vulnerable to changes associated with warming trends, droughts, and increased variability in precipitation. These climate changes are having differential impacts on ecosystem services that are critical to livelihood enterprises. Strategies for how resource managers and the research community can better collaborate and more effectively codesign and coproduce efforts to understand and to respond to these challenges are needed.

However, there has been little research undertaken directly with young people in relation to social and digital media's reporting of climate change, and how this is experienced by young people. Method This study aimed to explore the interface between climate change and social media reporting for young people. A two-stage iterative approach to recruitment and data collection included an initial qualitative stage (N = 28), consisting of open-ended questions about social media's reporting of climate change issues. The second stage (N = 23) included further open-ended questions and 10 Likert-Scale questions. Overall, 51 young people 16-25-years-old opted to take part (M = 11; F = 40). Descriptive statistics and an inductive data-driven content analysis are reported. Results Overall, 95% of the participants reported that they had the personal skills to cope with climate change reporting on social media. Most participants stated that coverage on the climate increased 'climate change anxiety' but not their overall mental health difficulties. A four-stage experiential process of observing social media's reporting of climate change, feeling emotionally affected by the reporting, critically apprising the content and feeling motivated to engage in climate change activism emerged from the content analysis. The participants discussed experiences of digital media, rather than solely social media, in their accounts. Conclusions The participants recommended changes to climate change reporting and increasing access to education about climate change issues to reduce anxiety and enhance motivation for positive personal engagement. Involving young people in conversations and education about climate change were seen as protective factors for mental health and enablers for motivation. Motivation, agency and pathways for positive change were associated with hopefulness.","2022-02","2023-09-26 16:11:52","2023-09-26 16:11:52","","30-38","","1","27","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000729616700001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;9<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;9<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;34</p>","","","Climate change; climate anxiety; social media; SOCIAL MEDIA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The data used to calibrate and evaluate three crop models were obtained from a field experiment with two irrigation amounts and two wheat cultivars that have different phenology and growth habit. After calibration, the model was applied to fifty locations across the wheat-growing area of the UK to cover all the main growing regions, with most points located in the main growing areas. Four GCMs, with two cultivars and five planting dates, were simulated at the end of the century. Results of this study showed that the UK potential wheat yield will increase by 2-8% under projected climate. Farmers will need to close such a gap in the future because it will have implications in terms of food security. Future climatic conditions might increase such a gap. Adaptation measures (e.g. moving the optimal planting time), along with climate-ready varieties bred for future conditions and with precision agriculture techniques can help to reduce this gap and ensure that the future actual UK wheat production will be close to the potential.","2021-09","2023-09-26 16:11:52","2023-09-26 16:11:52","","511-522","","7-8","159","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000741360900006","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;64</p>","","","ADAPTATION; TEMPERATURE; Climate change; UNCERTAINTY; CLIMATE; YIELD; GROWTH; ABILITY; climate impacts; CROP; crop models; CULTIVARS; WITHSTAND DROUGHT","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such changes play different roles with regard to regional climate change, with the most significant effect on drylands. To guarantee local crop yields and preserve ecosystems, identification of the changes of the four seasons in drylands is important. Our results show that, relative to humid lands, changing trends in lengths of spring, summer, and autumn were particularly enhanced in drylands of the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes during 1951-2020. In this period, summer length has increased by 0.51 days per year, while spring and autumn lengths have both contracted by 0.14 days per year. However, the enhanced changes in drylands did not appear in winter length. The winter has shortened by 0.23 days per year in drylands. Such changes of spring, summer, and autumn in drylands are dominated by internal variability over the entire study period, with a stronger external forcing effect on drylands than on humid lands. In drylands, the external forcing contributed to the lengths of spring, summer, and autumn by 30.1%, 42.2%, and 29.4%, respectively. The external forcing has become an increasingly important component since 1990, with the ability to dominate all seasons in drylands after 2010. Nevertheless, only 1 of the 16 models from phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) used in this study can capture the enhanced changes in the lengths of spring, summer, and autumn in drylands. Further investigation on the local effects of changes in seasons on agriculture and ecosystem would be needed, especially for the fragile regions.","2021-10","2023-09-26 16:11:52","2023-09-26 16:11:52","","8181-8190","","20","34","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000752637600006","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;7<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;7<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;46</p>","","","Climate change; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PHENOLOGY; ONSET; Climate variability; Atmosphere; COLD-SEASON; Drought; UNITED-STATES","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The daily gridded precipitation data from five global climate models (GCMs) of phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIPs) are chosen to investigate natural variability and precipitation extremes during the last millennium (850-1849), the historical (1850-2005) period, and two representative concentration pathway (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5) scenarios (2006-99). First, the seasonal and annual precipitation and extreme statistics from GCMs are evaluated using reconstruction and observation. Second, the spatial and temporal patterns of extreme precipitation from GCMs are investigated from the last millennium to the end of the twenty-first century. Meanwhile, the characteristic changes of extreme precipitation for the five regions of Europe are further analyzed. The results revealed the following: GCMs underestimate extreme precipitation and overestimate mean precipitation compared with the observations from European Climate Assessment and Dataset (ECA & D); the majority of Europe except southern Europe will most likely have large magnitude increases in the extreme precipitation and mean precipitation in the future under both RCP scenarios; there is no systematic change of precipitation extremes from the last millennium to the historical period from all GCMs; and larger magnitude increases are shown in 100- and 200-yr than in 5- and 10-yr return period precipitation from both RCP scenarios. In addition, short-duration extreme precipitation will most likely increase more than longer-duration extremes.","2021-01","2023-09-26 16:11:51","2023-09-26 16:11:51","","567-588","","2","34","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000615485000008","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;16<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;18<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;52</p>","","","RAINFALL; TEMPERATURE; VARIABILITY; Climate change; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PROJECTIONS; Precipitation; Climate variability; INDEXES; ANNUAL MAXIMUM; Europe; FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; HYDROCLIMATE; INTENSE PRECIPITATION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We employ an approach combining biological traits with physiological metrics to differentiate climate hazards between 556 populations of fish and use these to assess the relative climate risk for 380 fishing fleets and 105 coastal regions in Europe. Countries in southeast Europe as well as the United Kingdom have the highest risks to both fishing fleets and coastal regions overall, while in other countries, the risk-profile is greater at either the fleet level or at the regional level. European fisheries face a diversity of challenges posed by climate change; climate adaptation, therefore, needs to be tailored to each country, region, and fleet's specific situation. Our analysis supports this process by highlighting where and what adaptation measures might be needed and informing where policy and business responses could have the greatest impact.","2021-10-05","2023-09-26 16:11:51","2023-09-26 16:11:51","","","","40","118","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000705926100006","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;26<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;26<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;71</p>","","","ADAPTATION; climate change; IMPACTS; MANAGEMENT; STRATEGIES; climate risk; DEPENDENT COMMUNITIES; FISHING COMMUNITIES; fishing fleets; FUZZY-LOGIC; MARINE; SOCIAL VULNERABILITY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The notion (and the scientific term) of climate was established during the Greek antiquity in a geographical context and it acquired its statistical content (average weather) in modern times after meteorological measurements had become common. Yet the modern definitions of climate are seriously affected by the wrong perception of the previous two centuries that climate should regularly be constant, unless an external agent acts upon it. Therefore, we attempt to give a more rigorous definition of climate, consistent with the modern body of stochastics. We illustrate the definition by real-world data, which also exemplify the large climatic variability. Given this variability, the term ""climate change"" turns out to be scientifically unjustified. Specifically, it is a pleonasm as climate, like weather, has been ever-changing. Indeed, a historical investigation reveals that the aim in using that term is not scientific but political. Within the political aims, water issues have been greatly promoted by projecting future catastrophes while reversing true roles and causality directions. For this reason, we provide arguments that water is the main element that drives climate, and not the opposite.","2021-02","2023-09-26 16:11:51","2023-09-26 16:11:51","","","","6","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000651947400001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;11<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;11<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;118</p>","","","climate change; TEMPERATURE; hydrology; water; HYDROLOGY; climate; EVENTS; ALBEDO; climatology; CYCLES; ICE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, from the mid-1990s to the early 2010s, northern China experienced a period of increasing occurrence of low temperature extremes (LTE). Factors responsible for this increase of LTE are investigated in this analysis. The results show that the interdecadal variation of the winter mean temperature over mid- and high-latitude Eurasia acts as an important thermal background. It is characterized by two dominant modes, the ""consistent cooling'' pattern and the ""warm high-latitude Eurasia and cold midlatitude Eurasia'' pattern, from the mid-1990s to the early 2010s. The two patterns jointly provide a cooling background for the increase of LTE in northern China. Meanwhile, though the interdecadal variation of the Arctic Oscillation (AO), Ural blocking (UB), and Siberian high (SH) are all highly correlated with the occurrence of LTE in northern China, the AO is found to play a dominant role. On one hand, the AO directly affects the occurrence of LTE because of its dynamic structure; on the other hand, it takes an indirect effect by affecting the intensity of UB and SH. Further analyses show that the winter temperature in mid- and high-latitude Eurasia and the AO are independent factors that influence the increase of LTE in northern China from the mid-1990s to the early 2010s.","2021-09","2023-09-26 16:11:51","2023-09-26 16:11:51","","1207-1218","","9","60","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000754475800002","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;73</p>","","","TRENDS; VARIABILITY; Climate change; CLIMATE-CHANGE; Climate variability; EVENTS; INDEXES; Extreme events; ARCTIC SEA-ICE; ASSOCIATION; BLOCKING; COLD SURGE; PART II","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Understanding climate change and its impact drivers on dryland is essential for supporting dryland planning and sustainable development. Using meteorological observations for 1960-2019, the aridity changes in drylands of China were evaluated using aridity index (AI), and the impact of various climatic factors [i.e., precipitation P; sunshine duration (SSD); relative humidity (RH); maximum temperature (Tmax); minimum temperature (Tmin); wind speed (WS)] on the aridity changes was decomposed and quantified. Results of trend analysis based on Sen's slope estimator and Mann-Kendall test indicated that the aridity trends were very weak when averaged over the whole drylands in China during 1960-2019 but exhibited a significant wetting trend in hyperarid and arid regions of drylands. The AI was most sensitive to changes in water factors (i.e., P and RH), followed by SSD, Tmax, and WS, but the sensitivity of AI to Tmin was very small and negligible. Interestingly, the dominant climatic driver to AI change varied in the four dryland subtypes. The significantly increased P dominated the increase in AI in the hyperarid and arid regions. The significantly reduced WS and the significantly increased Tmax contributed more to AI changes than the P in the semiarid and dry subhumid regions of drylands. Previous studies emphasized the impact of precipitation and temperature on the global or regional dry-wet changes; however, the findings of this study suggest that, beyond precipitation and temperature, the impact of wind speed on aridity changes of drylands in China should be given equal attention.","2021-04","2023-09-26 16:11:51","2023-09-26 16:11:51","","607-617","","4","60","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000644122400012","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;69</p>","","","RAINFALL; DROUGHT; Climate change; Climate variability; Climate classification; Climate sensitivity; DESERTIFICATION; INDIAN-OCEAN; METEOROLOGICAL VARIABLES; NORTHERN CHINA; PACIFIC DECADAL OSCILLATION; PENMAN-MONTEITH; POTENTIAL EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; regimes; SOUTHERN OSCILLATION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this modeling framework, on average the direct radiative process accounts for 13% of the total warming. The radiation increases the atmospheric lapse rate and triggers more convection, which further produces 74% of the total warming. The remaining 13% is attributable to the circulation adjustment. The relative importance of these processes differs in different regions. In the deep tropics, the radiative-convective adjustment produces the most significant warming and accounts for almost 100% of the total warming. In the subtropics, the radiative-convective adjustment accounts for 73% of the total warming and the circulation adjustment plays a more important role than in the deep tropics, especially at the levels above 200 hPa. When the lateral boundary conditions (i.e., the temperature and water vapor advections) are held fixed in single-column simulations, the tropospheric relative humidity significantly increases in the radiative-convective adjustment in response to the surface warming. This result, in contrast to the relative humidity conservation behavior in the GCM, highlights the importance of circulation adjustment in maintaining the constant relative humidity. The tropical upper-tropospheric warming in both the full GCM and the single-column simulations is found to be less strong than the warming predicted by reference moist adiabats. This evidences that the sub-moist-adiabatic warming occurs even without the dilution effect of the large-scale circulation adjustment.","2021-07","2023-09-26 16:11:51","2023-09-26 16:11:51","","5337-5348","","13","34","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000775651000011","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;41</p>","","","VARIABILITY; Climate change; MODEL; SCALE; CIRCULATION; ATMOSPHERE; AMPLIFICATION; Climate models; CLIMATE SIMULATIONS; CONVECTION; FEEDBACKS; TEMPERATURE TRENDS; Tropical variability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using data from Earth observations and climate model simulations, we here develop a statistical learning analysis of how clouds respond to changes in the environment. We show that global cloud feedback is dominated by the sensitivity of clouds to surface temperature and tropospheric stability. Considering changes in just these two factors, we are able to constrain global cloud feedback to 0.43 +/- 0.35 W center dot m-2 center dot K-1 (90% confidence), implying a robustly amplifying effect of clouds on global warming and only a 0.5% chance of ECS below 2 K.

This article discusses the opportunities in this context for those who face displacement by the effects of climate change, an issue that is not necessarily at the heart of either climate justice debates or climate displacement debates. Discussions about how to respond to displacement arising in the context of climate change often focus on the 'protection space' or 'assistance space', in which those affected are conceptualized as actual or potential seekers of protection or assistance, who may or may not be owed refuge elsewhere on account of unmet needs for shelter, support or safety. This article takes a different approach and conceptualizes those affected as potential or actual seekers of justice, who may be owed rectification for inflicted harm. The article thus contributes to emerging scholarship concerning climate change litigation and climate harm reversal, by focusing on the corrective justice potential for those who face the specific issue of displacement stemming from climate change. To this end, the article provides the relevant practical and analytical background, and discusses key recent law and policy developments in both the domestic and cross-border spheres.

Crop production is directly related to climatic variables. Temperature, solar radiation, wind, precipitation, CO2 concentration and other climatic variables dictate crop yield. This study, based on long-term historical data, investigates the patterns and changes in climatic variables (precipitation, temperature, and solar radiation) that would most significantly affect the future crop production in many parts of the world, and especially in India, where most farmers depend on rainfall for rice production. Statistical analyses-box and whisker plot, mean absolute error, Taylor diagram, double mass curve, Mann-Kendall trend test, and projected climate change-were used to assess the significance of the climatic factors for the purpose of agricultural modeling. Large variability in precipitation may cause the flash floods and affect the farming, and at the same time, increase in temperature from baseline period will lead to high water requirement by crops, and may cause drought if rainfall does not occur.

While acting as the key nodes of globalisation and international business, seaports are exposed to the vulnerability of climate impacts, mainly because of their locations, including low-lying areas, coastal zones, and deltas. The paper is to develop a Climate Change Risk Indicator (CCRI) framework for climate risk assessment of seaports, enabling research-informed policymaking on such a demanding topic. Due to the increasing number of extreme weather events (EWEs), climate change adaptation is becoming an essential and necessary issue to be addressed by seaport stakeholders. Climate risk analysis aids rational adaptation planning. Many climate assessments have been done for measuring climate vulnerabilities, and various climate adaptation measures have been proposed for reducing climate risks. However, few of them used quantitative approaches for climate risk evaluations in seaports and fewer on the provisions of CCRIs for comparing climate risks of different locations and timeframes to guide rational policy making. Furthermore, climate change is a dynamic issue, requiring big objective data to support the analysis (e.g. monthly climate data on CCRIs) of climate threats and vulnerabilities. In this paper, Evidence Reasoning (ER) is employed to evaluate the climate risks in seaports by tackling the incomplete data. The findings reveal the quantitative measures of climate change risks in different locations and in different months. Furthermore, the risk levels of seaports in the future are assessed for observing the changes and informing policy making. The main contributions of this study include the visualisation of the comprehensive climate risk levels and provision of a new climate risk analysis framework through the comparison of climate change risks with respect to different locations and timeframes. Suitable climate adaptation measures can be chosen to implement, and seaports can cooperate on climate resilience issues (e.g. seaport network service and pre-disaster relief logistics).","2021-05-01","2023-09-26 16:11:50","2023-09-26 16:11:50","","","","","205","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000640904700004","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;7<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;7<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;100</p>","","","ADAPTATION; SEA-LEVEL RISE; Climate change adaptation; IMPACTS; COASTAL VULNERABILITY; Climate resilience; HEAT; Climate change risk indicators; Climate vulnerability assessment; DELTA; EVIDENTIAL REASONING APPROACH; FMEA; Seaport resilience; VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT; ZONE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Insights into a two-year long educational programme in North Tyrol (Austria) and South Tyrol (Italy)","CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT","","2212-0963","10.1016/j.crm.2021.100327","","Adapting to anthropogenic climate change requires informed citizens capable of managing personal and societal risks. This study explores the contribution of climate change education (CCE) to build adolescents' cognitive adaptive capacity. As defined by Grothmann and Patt's (2005) Model of Private Proactive Adaptation to Climate Change (MPPACC), cognitive dimensions of adaptive capacity correspond to climate change risk perception and adaptation appraisal as preconditions for individual adaptation actions. Their model has been operationalised to examine adolescents' cognitive adaptive capacity in a pre-test-post-test design, and the educational programme Generation F3-Fit for Future is presented as a quasi-experiment linking this concept with CCE. Because cognitive adaptive capacity is a complex and multifaceted concept, this contribution also studies the influence of CCE on knowledge and thinking skills, which are important dimensions as well. Overall, 173 upper-secondary school students aged between 16 and 18 years actively collaborated with 57 scientific and practical experts on climate change adaptation (CCA) in North and South Tyrol. Additionally, the programme included control groups. Over two school years, Generation F3-Fit for Future encouraged students to follow constructivist inquiry-based CCE, and they carried out their own research-oriented CCA projects. A mixed methods approach compared data from a multivariate multilevel mixed model collected by web-based questionnaires (N = 231) and qualitative data from problem-centred interviews (N = 47), which were analysed by documentary method. The results suggest a mismatch between quantitative and qualitative data. Quantitative data do not show any change in adolescents' risk perception and adaptation appraisal, but qualitative data reveal that intervention group students demonstrated increased levels of adaptation knowledge and elaborated critical as well as forward thinking skills. Control group students did not show such capacities after standard curriculum education. It is concluded that CCE holds potential to build several dimensions of adolescents' cognitive adaptive capacity. Upcoming research should further explore mixed research approaches and advance adaptive capacity theory to better understand this concept.","2021","2023-09-26 16:11:50","2023-09-26 16:11:50","","","","","33","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000689657300001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;67</p>","","","Climate change; CHILDREN; KNOWLEDGE; Adaptation; CHANGE ADAPTATION; Climate change education; Adolescents; Capacity building; TYPOLOGY; YOUNG-PEOPLE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

How preservice teachers understand climate change, and the often misunderstood relationship between ozone depletion and global warming, critically impacts the students they will teach. This mixed method, descriptive study explores preservice teachers' climate change and ozone depletion knowledge, and documents the sources of their ideas. Elementary preservice science teachers from three colleges of education in Ghana completed a survey (N = 255) and interview (n = 30). Exploratory factor analysis yielded six factors related to ozone depletion and four related to climate change knowledge. Survey and interview responses revealed that the preservice teachers could explain that stratospheric ozone is a layer of gas in the atmosphere that prevents ultraviolet radiation from reaching Earth. Yet, they could not describe how ozone forms and the mechanism of ozone destruction. The preservice teachers confused climate change with changes in weather and seasons, but could explain how anthropogenic activities like deforestation and burning fossil fuels contribute to climate change. About 88% of the participants thought climate change and ozone depletion were causally linked - either ozone depletion caused climate change, or climate change caused ozone depletion. The participating preservice teachers identified textbooks (80%), instructors (64%), and the media (62%) as the main sources of their ozone depletion and climate change knowledge. We identified a mix of knowledge gaps and coherent ideas that offer scaffolds on which to improve teachers' knowledge of climate change and ozone depletion.","2021-07-03","2023-09-26 16:11:50","2023-09-26 16:11:50","","1554-1575","","10","43","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000648453200001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;39</p>","","","Climate change; LAYER DEPLETION; ozone depletion-climate change assessment; ozone layer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Encompassing European Union (EU) countries, the objective of this paper was to analyse how economic development and Hofstede's cultural dimensions contributed to climate change concerns, personal responsibility, and actions related to climate change mitigation. Furthermore, considering that actions related to climate change mitigation have different costs and benefits, in this study, we aimed to reveal whether climate change concerns and personal responsibility equally influenced all actions related to climate change mitigation and whether all types of actions were guided by the same goals. The results showed that the performance of actions related to climate change mitigation varied across European countries. The largest share of respondents declared that they reduce waste and regularly separate it for recycling. Meanwhile, a smaller share of people noted that they perform very high-cost actions such as the purchase of low-energy homes and electric cars. Economic development level significantly affects the assumption of personal responsibility and the number of actions related to climate change mitigation but not climate change concerns. Hofstede's cultural dimensions influence climate change concerns, responsibility, and the number of actions differently. Considering separate actions related to climate change mitigation, the assumption of personal responsibility significantly and positively influenced almost all actions. Climate change concerns positively and significantly affected only low-cost actions. Because of the different costs and guiding goals, the respondents who performed one action did not necessarily perform other actions related to climate change mitigation. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

United States, climate scientist Kevin Trenberth used the ""storyline"" approach to extreme event attribution to argue that greenhouse warming had affected and will affect extreme events in their regions to such an extent that the plaintiffs already had been or will be harmed. The storyline approach to attribution is deterministic rather than probabilistic, taking certain factors as contingent and assessing the role of climate change conditional on those factors. The US Government's opposing expert witness argued that Trenberth had failed to make his case because ""all his conclusions of the injuries to Plaintiffs suffer from the same failure to connect his conditional approach to Plaintiffs' local circumstances."" The issue is whether it is possible to make statements about individual events based on general knowledge. A similar question is sometimes debated within the climate science community. We argue here that proceeding from the general to the specific is a process of deduction and is an entirely legitimate form of scientific reasoning. We further argue that it is well aligned with the concept of legal evidence, much more so than the more usual inductive form of scientific reasoning, which proceeds from the specific to the general. This has implications for how attribution science can be used to support climate change litigation. ""The question is"", said Alice, ""whether you can make words mean different things.""

This has led to a focus on suboptimal intervention strategies, particularly informational approaches. Addressing the climate crisis requires a focus on high-impact behaviours and high-emitting groups; interdisciplinary interventions that address the multiple drivers, barriers and contexts of behaviour; and timing to ensure interventions are targeted to moments of change when habits are weaker.","2021-12","2023-09-26 16:11:49","2023-09-26 16:11:49","","76-81","","","42","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000700610700014","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;47<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;48<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;92</p>","","","ADAPTATION; Climate change; SCIENCE; PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT; DECISION-MAKING; PATTERNS; Behaviour change; HABIT DISCONTINUITY; INTERVENTIONS; Psychology; SOCIAL-INFLUENCE; SPILLOVER; TRAVEL","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a result of being such a recent concern, the available definitions of what is at stake and what is needed to deal with it-in particular who should deal with it-are often too broad, vague and even disputable depending on the interlocutors, and often focussed on the rural areas. In the context of urban climate change in Luanda and in Maputo, there is an undefined set of tasks and responsibilities to deal with the impacts and prevent further negative effects to the urban dwellers and the poor in particular. This article identifies recurrently mentioned areas where the state is considered absent (and should be present). Based on fieldwork conducted in Luanda and in Maputo, the available literature, accounts of expert stakeholders, and the appraisals and claims of the urban dwellers, this article analyses the existing legal and policy dispositions and the existing systems and resources to deal with climate change. This is simultaneously confronted with what policy stakeholders, urban practitioners and urban dwellers on the ground see that is missing, needs to be improved, and is urgent and capable of improving daily lives. The main findings are that responsibilities and attributions, despite being unclear and not fully defined, predominantly rely on the state and state institutions.","2022-03","2023-09-26 16:11:49","2023-09-26 16:11:49","","35-49","","1","33","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000646627100001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;36</p>","","","ADAPTATION; Climate change; CHALLENGES; RISK; GOVERNANCE; ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE; CITY; Luanda; Maputo; State agency; Urban climate change","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Articles included in the review address human mortality related to climate change. The review yielded two broad themes in the literature that addressed the factors that influence climate change-related mortality.

The meteorological impacts of climate change yield a complex cascade of environmental and weather events that affect ambient temperatures, air quality, drought, wildfires, precipitation, and vector-, food-, and water-borne pathogens. The identified social and demographic factors were related to the social determinants of health. The environmental changes from climate change amplify the existing health determinants that influence mortality within the United States.

The intertwined, complex relationship between the sector and climate change is among the unprecedented challenges now facing the European Union (EU). The complexity of the relationship calls for the establishment of a sustainable, future climate-proof, adapted and resilient sector with strong adaptive capacity. This paper argues that over the past decades, strong emphasis has been placed on how to mitigate the negative effects of climate change across the sector, causing it to fall behind in terms of adaptation. Although adaptation is now part of the sector's development agenda, sectoral adaptation performance across member states remains low. In order to justify an accelerated adaptation process across the sector, the paper develops a Relative Climate Change Adaption Index (RCCAI) for the sector based on Eurostat data. The analysis shows that there is no single member state across the EU whose agricultural sector can be considered as fully climate-adapted (resilient), and thus validates the hypothesis that adaption efforts must be stepped up across the sector. To ensure continued sectoral adaptive capacity improvement, the paper recommends coherent integration and accelerated implementation of adaptation practices and policies alongside the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) for the sake of both private and public interests.","2021","2023-09-26 16:11:49","2023-09-26 16:11:49","","8-22","","1","123","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000660972000002","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;112</p>","","","Climate change; BIODIVERSITY; IMPACTS; STRATEGIES; POLICIES; adaptation; climate-adapted agriculture; climate-proof agriculture; Relative Climate Change Adaptation Index; SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT; WATER MANAGEMENT","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Building upon the literature of ecoanxiety and the palliative function of ideological beliefs, we assumed that the acknowledgment of climate change intensifies ecoanxiety while climate change denial eases it. More importantly, we also assumed that the extent of this ease is larger in countries being more threatened by the harmful consequences of climate change. To test this assumption, we analyzed data collected from representative samples of 23 European countries within European Social Survey Programme, and additional data on the actual exposure of these countries to the effects of climate change. Results of our multilevel models showed that climate change denial is related to lower ecoanxiety, and this negative relationship is stronger at high (vs. low) levels of climate change exposure. Our results support the general principle stating that the harsher reality is the larger emotional benefit can be achieved by its distorted perception and denial. This psychological defense mechanism can partly explain why many people are reluctant to fight against climate change even in countries that are threatened by it.","2021-03-01","2023-09-26 16:11:49","2023-09-26 16:11:49","","48-54","","1","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000626695200006","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;36</p>","","","Climate change denial; Climate change exposure; Ecoanxiety; Palliative ideology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The findings from this study suggest that energy and its price may influence a major impact of climate change challenge. The respondents view on competitive risk is found as the most critical climate change threat. Top management commitment is viewed as a key driver to propose a likely framework. The mitigation action that most organisations have undertaken is energy efficiency. Further, multiple regression analysis shows a significant relationship between climate change risks and drivers, and climate change risks and mitigation activities.

Overall, we find no systematic disagreements between the feedbacks in the model ensembles and feedbacks inferred from observations, although there is a wide range in the ability of individual models to reproduce the observations. In particular, 40 of 52 models have best estimates that fall within the uncertainty of the observed total feedback. We quantify two sources of uncertainty in the model ensembles: 1) the structural difference, due to the differences in model parameterization, and 2) the unforced pattern effect, due to unforced variability, and find that both are important when comparing with an 18-yr observational dataset. We perform the comparison using two energy balance frameworks: the traditional energy balance framework, in which it is assumed that changes in energy balance are controlled by changes in global average surface temperatures, and an alternative framework that assumes the changes in energy balance are controlled by tropical atmospheric temperatures. We find that the alternative framework provides a more robust way of comparing the models with observations, with both smaller structural differences and smaller unforced pattern effect. However, when considering the relation of feedbacks in response to interannual variability and long-term warming, the traditional framework has advantages. There are no great differences between the CMIP5 and CMIP6 ensembles' ability to reproduce the observed feedbacks.","2021-12","2023-09-26 16:11:49","2023-09-26 16:11:49","","9763-9773","","24","34","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000752652100011","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;45</p>","","","Climate change; IMPACT; DEPENDENCE; INTERNAL VARIABILITY; Climate models; Climate variability; Feedback; GLOBAL CLOUD; RADIATION; SENSITIVITY; SURFACE-TEMPERATURE-CHANGE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To address climate change, enhancing climate change risk perception and reducing climate change inaction are both critical. However, little research has touched on the issue of whether climate change risk perception is linked to climate change inaction in a negative manner. Moreover, there is still much unknown about the complex process behind this relationship, and the boundary conditions of this process awaits clarification. To address these gaps in the literature, two studies were conducted to first confirm the possible negative association between climate change risk perception and climate change inaction and, second, explore through a parallel mediational model whether climate change belief and environmental efficacy mediate simultaneously the relation between climate change risk perception and climate change inaction. Finally, a moderated sequential mediational model was used to investigate whether climate change risk perception is associated with climate change inaction through the sequential mediation of climate change belief and environmental efficacy, and to clarify underlying boundary conditions by analyzing the moderation of mindfulness as well. The results showed that, as expected, higher levels of climate change risk perception were related to less climate change inaction, and this relation was mediated by enhanced climate change belief and heightened environmental efficacy in a sequential manner. Furthermore, the sequential mediating effect of climate change belief and environmental efficacy was stronger among those who had a higher level of mindfulness. These findings advance the emerging research on climate change inaction by elucidating the mechanisms underlying the effect of climate change risk perception. Moreover, they extend the Domain-Context-Behavior (DCB) model and Gateway belief model (GBM). In practice, climate change education and climate change inaction interventions can be designed and implemented to nudge clean production, green supply chain and green consumption, which finally contribute to sustainable development and the `green transformation' of society.","2021-10-25","2023-09-26 16:11:49","2023-09-26 16:11:49","","","","","321","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000705777200048","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;28<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;28<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;135</p>","","","DETERMINANTS; SELF-EFFICACY; CHANGE ADAPTATION; Sustainable development; BELIEF; CHANGE EDUCATION; Climate change belief; Climate change inaction; Climate change risk perception; Environmental efficacy; MEDIATION; Mindfulness; MINDFULNESS MEDITATION; PSYCHOLOGICAL BARRIERS; SOCIAL-DOMINANCE ORIENTATION; WORLDVIEWS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is an urgent problem to find out the long-term climate change rules of this region. Using 101 tree core samples obtained from 54 trees, a 343-year tree-ring width chronology of the Platycladus orientalis (L.) Franco (1673?2016) in the Wula Mountains, Inner Mongolia, China was established. The analysis shows that the radial growth of P. orientalis is closely related to hydrothermal conditions, the average minimum temperature and relative humidity are the main factors that determine the growth of P. orientalis. Based on the strong correlation between the tree-ring indices and the annual average minimum temperature (r = -0.870, p < 0.001), we reconstructed an average annual minimum temperature series from 1673 to 2016 using a linear regression equation, and the reconstructed equation can explain 75.724% of the variance, respectively. According to the data from the past 343 years, the changes in the annual average minimum temperature series had the cycles of 58.6-, 7.7-, 3.4-, 3.1-, 2.2-, and 2.1years; the series showed three warm periods (1824?1830, 1909?1922, and 1986?2011) and 4 cold periods (1703?1712, 1731?1738, 1754?1763, and 1937?1951). The low temperature periods recorded in the reconstructed series for the 17th and 18th centuries are consistent with the Little Ice Age that occurred in the northern hemisphere, and the heating rate significantly increased at the end of the 20th century. In addition, the cold and warm periods recorded by the reconstruction result is basically consistent with the extreme climate events recorded in the historical documents of the region and the reconstruction results in other regions. In this paper, the world?s first chronology of P. orientalis tree ring width was established. A historical sequence of annual average minimum temperature of 343 years was reconstructed in a typical region of the East Asian monsoon climate. It fills in the blank of reconstruction sequence and variation characteristics of mean minimum temperature in the northern edge of East Asian monsoon and transition zone of temperate continental and monsoon climate in recent four centuries.","2021-05-10","2023-09-26 16:11:48","2023-09-26 16:11:48","","94-102","","","583","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000636691900009","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;60</p>","","","VARIABILITY; Climate change; VEGETATION; Climate reconstruction; Dendroclimatology; HUMIDITY; INNER-MONGOLIA; RADIAL GROWTH; RECORD; SUMMER TEMPERATURES; SUNSHINE DURATION; TREE-RING-WIDTH; WARMING HIATUS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the increasing availability of in situ data in this area allows a more comprehensive understanding of recent changes. This study used newly collected data from 41 stations to investigate climatic features and recent changes in the Alaskan Arctic from the mid-1940s to 2018. We found that the mean annual air temperature (MAAT) ranged from -11.0 to -6.4 degrees C, annual amplitude of air temperature (AAAT) ranged from 16 to 22 degrees C, annual precipitation ranged from 85 to 300 mm, and annual mean snow depth ranged from 13.5 to 34.5 cm during 2007-2012. Compared with data since the late 1980s, MAAT increased by similar to 2 degrees C near the coastline whereas AAAT did not significantly change. Changes in annual precipitation were complex among stations but showed a considerable increase in precipitation, snowfall, and snow depth during the cold months. The number of snow cover days declined, whereas the number of snowfall days increased at both Barrow and Kuparuk. This increase in snowfall events may be attributed to the declining sea ice concentration, which may enhance hydrological cycles. The observed bulk density of fresh snow was around 40-80 kg/m(3) and declined from the mid-1980s to the late-1990s, then increased until the end of the study period. This expanded in situ dataset provides a more comprehensive understanding of climatic conditions in the Alaskan Arctic and confirms rapid changes during recent decades. This study may also serve to validate and benchmark high-resolution climate models.","2021-02","2023-09-26 16:11:48","2023-09-26 16:11:48","","1251-1259","","3-4","143","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000604802500002","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;37</p>","","","TEMPERATURE; TRENDS; Climate change; PRECIPITATION; CYCLE; CLIMATOLOGY; Climate; ICE; Alaskan arctic; NORTHERN ALASKA; PERMAFROST; SNOW COVER","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Compared to observations, most models fail to simulate the correct ENSO-STV relationship in historical simulations. To investigate the possible bias in the ENSO-STV simulations, two possible processes for the connection between ENSO and winter STV are examined in high pattern score (HPS) models and low pattern score (LPS) models, respectively. On the one hand, both HPS and LPS models can overall reproduce a reasonable relationship between STV and the mean-flow conditions supporting extratropical eddy development. On the other hand, only HPS models can well capture the relationship between ENSO and the development of extratropical eddies, while LPS models fail to simulate this feature, indicating that the bias in the simulated ENSO-STV relationship among CMIP5/6 models can be traced back to ENSO simulation. Furthermore, the bias of the ENSO simulation is characterized by an unreasonable SST pattern bias, with an excessive westward extension of warm SST anomalies over the western Pacific and weak warm SST anomalies over the equatorial central-eastern Pacific, resulting in the underestimation of the zonal SST anomaly gradient among models. Therefore, the ENSO pattern bias induces an unrealistic circulation and temperature gradient over the Asian-Pacific-American region, affecting the simulations of the ENSO-STV connection. In addition, the ENSO-STV relationship over the Asian-Pacific-American region is still robust in future projections based on HPS models, providing implications for the selection of future climate predictors.","2021-12","2023-09-26 16:11:48","2023-09-26 16:11:48","","9899-9913","","24","34","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000752652100019","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;63</p>","","","Climate change; CLIMATE; CIRCULATION; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; TELECONNECTIONS; MONSOON; Climate variability; ARCTIC OSCILLATION; ATLANTIC; EL-NINO; ENSO; MODEL SIMULATIONS; TROPICAL PACIFIC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A dry period approach makes it possible to understand the intrinsic spatio-temporal characteristics: geography, seasonality, duration and frequency. In spring and autumn, the increase in the number of dry spells seems to be offset by the decrease in their average duration (and vice versa). The summer season, which is the driest season, has seen an increase in the number of dry days over most of the territory, mainly due to the increase in the average duration of dry spells and the number of the longest of them. In winter, the north of France is subject to an increase in the number of dry spells as well as the duration of the longest ones, leading to an increase in the total number of dry days. This study shows that an absence of clear and significant trends in the number of dry days in France does not necessarily mean that the temporal distribution of precipitation has not changed. An absence of trends in the number of dry days may hide an increase in the duration of the dry periods but a decrease in the number of these periods, or vice versa. These different modes of spatio-temporal variability in the absence of rain are all suitable scales for impact studies, particularly on economic activities dependent on the water cycle.","2021","2023-09-26 16:11:48","2023-09-26 16:11:48","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","French","","","","WOS:000878150100032","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;41</p>","","","climate change; EVOLUTION; climate variability; drought; DROUGHTS; MEDITERRANEAN REGION; SPELLS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the staging of major tourist events has not only led to increased CO2 emissions in Austria, the events themselves have also been affected by climate change. The paper at hand is based on a data collection and review process which covered the relevant peer reviewed and grey literature. This comprehensive process was based on, and was open to, contributions by the full scientific community of relevant Austrian researchers and experts. The compilation process of the report followed quality standards such as the involvement of international partners as review editors within the review process. In addition, the literature was surveyed to integrate the international state of the art. The paper discusses the relationship between events and climate change by looking at mitigation measures on the one hand as well as adaptive strategies taken by event organizers on the other. However, a significant lack of objective information and data as well as appropriate scientific studies also became obvious in this process. Against this background main tasks and challenges for further research are identified and discussed. The paper closes with managerial implications for the organization of major events. Management implications: The literature review and the analyses of case study reports on events support the following suggestions: Climate change mitigation measures and environmental issues should be already a significant part of the call, the following application by the destination and the final decision making. The application of specific environmental and climate friendly guidelines, awards or certificates are helpful tools to motivate the branch and to achieve ""green"" events. Measures related to transportation and mobility are crucial to achieve significant savings of greenhouse emissions. Further important aspects to be considered are waste management, catering, communication, accommodation and site selection. Climate research may help to define a suitable period for the event at the desired location which is likely to avoid or reduce possible climate change related risks such as extreme heat or lack of snows.","2021-06","2023-09-26 16:11:48","2023-09-26 16:11:48","","","","","34","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000697164700008","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;103</p>","","","VARIABILITY; DEMAND; IMPACT; POLICY; SCENARIOS; Climate change mitigation; Climate change adaption; DESTINATIONS; EUROPEAN ALPS; Events; MEGA-EVENTS; SPORTING EVENT; Tourism; TOURISM","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An online study (N = 161) compared groups of participants who received messages focusing on individual or collective behaviour. Relative to a control group, these groups showed increased levels of response efficacy but not self-efficacy. However, this did not translate to increased climate commitment; mediation analysis suggested that the video messages, while increasing efficacy, may also have had a counterproductive effect on behavioural intentions, possibly by reducing the perceived urgency of action. This finding reinforces the challenge faced by climate communicators seeking to craft a message that boosts efficacy and simultaneously motivates adaptive responses to the climate crisis.","2022-07-03","2023-09-26 16:11:48","2023-09-26 16:11:48","","375-395","","3","28","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000703185900001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;47</p>","","","Climate change; COGNITIVE THEORY; COLLECTIVE EFFICACY; FEAR APPEALS; PROTECTION MOTIVATION THEORY; SELF-EFFICACY; WILLINGNESS; INTENTIONS; PERCEPTIONS; climate communication; efficacy; PRO-ENVIRONMENTAL BEHAVIOR; THREAT","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, based on questionnaires surveys of 143 representative government officials, experts, scholars, and industry engineers from developing countries who have been engaged in climate change, the current situation and priority requirements of developing countries in terms of policies and actions, technology, financing, capacity building, and international cooperation for addressing climate change were systematically analyzed. We found that 1. Most developing countries have already taken national general actions and sectoral and industry-level actions focus on renewable or clean energy, waste management and recycling, sustainable urban transport and forestry carbon sequestration. 2. The demands for climate change mitigation are mainly concentrated in technology and capital, and the priority areas are energy and electricity and waste management; for climate change adaptation, the demands differ significantly among regions. 3. Developing countries show high preferences for emission reduction and energy-saving technology, solar energy, wind energy and bio-energy, whereas a low preference for supercritical and ultra supercritical power units, nuclear energy and tidal energy. 4. Agroforestry, energy conservation and efficiency, renewable energy and water resources are priority areas for climate change financing. 5. Building institutional capacity, improving technology R&D networks and institutions, formulation and implementation ability of planning schemes, and data statistics and verification are priority areas needed for capacity building.

We conceptualize skeptic/skepticism as an umbrella term that includes those who actively reject climate science and those who are uncertain about climate change. We propose four categories for better empirical analysis of climate skepticism: epistemic deniers, epistemic doubters (borrowing from Capstick and Pidgeon 2014), attribution deniers, and attribution doubters (borrowing from Rahmstorf 2004). Using a unique dataset of surveys (n = 1000) and interviews (n = 33) with residents of the U.S. Pacific Northwest who are skeptical about climate change, we compare those four groups across several predictors and demographic variables (age, race, gender, political ideology, religiosity, income, education, and level of trust in science) and outcome variables (environmental concern, policy support, and conspiracy ideation (adherence to the belief that climate change is a ""hoax""). We demonstrate the importance of considering attitudinal uncertainty in the analysis of climate skepticism by providing evidence for the presence of a continuum of thought wherein epistemic deniers and attribution doubters make up the two ends of a continuum with more complicated distinctions between epistemic doubters and attribution deniers.","2021-05","2023-09-26 16:11:48","2023-09-26 16:11:48","","","","","68","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000663342300010","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;9<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;9<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;45</p>","","","SUPPORT; ANTI-REFLEXIVITY; Climate skepticism; Perceptions of climate change; Uncertainty and climate change","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, there is considerably more variability in level of concern and, it appears, in everyday sustainable behavior. But how does personality affect this variability in behavior? And how are underlying personality states like dispositional optimism linked to more sustainable everyday practices? Research in clinical psychology has suggested that dispositional optimism is a very positive personality characteristic associated with higher levels of hope and resilience, but applied research from other domains has reported that optimists can, on occasion, bury their heads in the sand and avoid attending to external threats, like climate change, in order to maintain mood state. So are optimists more immune to climate change messaging than non-optimists? And do they make fewer sustainable choices? A series of experimental studies, manipulating signifiers of carbon footprint (Study 1) and eco labels on products (Study 2) found that optimists made more sustainable choices than non-optimists and that both groups were influenced equally by climate change film clips in terms of sustainable choices (Study 1). Optimists also displayed a false consensus effect, overestimating the proportion of people who would behave more sustainably like themselves (Study 3). Given that global problems like climate change need concerted, cooperative effort, these optimistic beliefs about how others behave could be adaptive in the long-run. Designing climate change messages to appeal to optimists might be a critical consideration for the future.","2021-07","2023-09-26 16:11:48","2023-09-26 16:11:48","","237-273","","241","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000672584600011","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;73</p>","","","climate change; ATTITUDES; INFORMATION; behaviour change; KNOWLEDGE; ATTENTION; climate change films; dispositional optimism; DISPOSITIONAL OPTIMISM; GAZE; ICONIC HAND GESTURES; INCONVENIENT TRUTH; low carbon choice; PESSIMISM; semiotics of climate change; UNREALISTIC OPTIMISM","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, few studies have attempted to evaluate deforestation and vegetation degradation fires (DDF) and predict how they will change in the future. In this study, we expanded a fire model used in the Community Land Model to reflect the diverse causes of DDF. This enabled us to differentiate DDFs by cause (climate change, wood harvesting, and cropland, pastureland, and urban land-use changes) and seasonality. We then predicted the state of fire regimes in the 2050s and 2090s under RCP 2.6 and RCP 6.0 scenarios. Our results indicate that the area affected by global total fires will decrease from the current 452 to 211-378 Mha yr(-1) in the 2090s under RCP 6.0 and to 184-333 Mha yr(-1) under RCP 2.6, mainly due to socioeconomic factors such as population and economic growth. We also predict that DDF will decrease from the current 73 million hectares per year (Mha yr(-1)) to 54-66 Mha yr(-1) in the 2090s under RCP 6.0 and 46-55 Mha yr(-1) under RCP 2.6. The main contributor to these decreases in DDF burned area was climate change, especially the increasing of precipitation. The impact of future land use change on future DDF was similar or slightly lower than present-day. South America, Indonesia, and Australia were identified as high-risk regions for future DDF, mainly due to the expansion of wood harvest and pastureland. Appropriate land and fire management policies will be needed to reduce future fire damage in these areas.","2021-05","2023-09-26 16:11:48","2023-09-26 16:11:48","","","","5","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000656968900015","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;85</p>","","","climate change; MODEL; CLIMATE; DYNAMICS; land use change; EMISSIONS; AIR-POLLUTION; CARBON; climate change risk; EARTH SYSTEM; BURNED AREA; fire risk; LAND-USE CHANGE; socioeconomic change; TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we attempted to provide a broader picture of potential climate change impacts on the geostructures in Europe by gathering the collective view of geo-engineers and geo-scientists in several countries, and by considering different geo-structure types. We also investigated how geo-structural concerns are being addressed in national adaptation plans. We found that specific provisions for geo-structural adaptation are generally lacking and mainly come in the form of strategies for specific problems. In this regard, two common strategies are hazard/risk assessment and monitoring, which are mainly implemented in relation to slope stability. We recommend that in future steps, other geo-structures are likewise given attention, particularly those assessed as also potentially significantly affected by climate change.

But so far scholars have not studied the emotions expressed by self-declared climate change skeptics; nor have social scientists turned to affect studies to develop nuanced understandings of the constellation of emotions related to fear. Our team conducted 33 interviews and 1000 surveys with self-identified skeptics living in the U.S. Pacific Northwest. The data demonstrates the variability in perspectives, ideologies, and behaviors among skeptics themselves in new and unique ways, including tracking skeptics' emotions about climate change. This article focuses on worry and dread. We find that those who believe climate change is a hoax, and skeptics who are politically conservative, tend to express less of these two emotions, as do men who identify as skeptics. Religiosity, as measured by frequency of religious attendance, does not significantly correlate with worry and dread; however, specific religious beliefs related to climate change (e.g. ""Climate change is punishment for our sins"") do seem to increase those two feelings. Negative firsthand environmental experiences are also associated with higher degrees of worry and dread. Perhaps most significantly, our data suggests that worry and dread correlate strongly with environmental concern and policy support. Our interdisciplinary approach has several methodological advantages. First, affect studies encourages more nuance in emotion language, including more detailed definitions of emotions like worry and dread, which simmer over time, as opposed to discrete emotions like fear, which are shorter-lived. Second, sociological approaches remind us that emotions function within particular political, historical, and cultural contexts, which are fundamentally shaped by power structures. Finally, humanities scholars can provide useful input both in research design and the interpretation of results by helping craft survey questions and data codes, and by providing close attention to the language of the survey and interview responses. Combined with quantitative data, this multipronged methodology brings together forms of knowledge from the humanities and social sciences. Our approach serves as a model for new work in the growing field of empirical ecocriticism and expands the boundaries of the environmental humanities.","2021-05","2023-09-26 16:11:48","2023-09-26 16:11:48","","","","","39","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000652739400010","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;8<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;8<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;53</p>","","","ENGAGEMENT; FEAR; Climate skepticism; Perceptions of climate change; Climate change and emotions; EMOTION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Herein the natural variability of the global surface temperature is modeled using a set of harmonics spanning from the inter-annual to the millennial scales. The model is supported by the following considerations: (1) power spectrum evaluations show 11 spectral peaks (from the sub-decadal to the multi-decadal scales) above the 99% confidence level of the known temperature uncertainty; (2) spectral coherence analysis between the independent global surface temperature periods 1861-1937 and 1937-2013 highlights at least eight common frequencies between 2- and 20-year periods; (3) paleoclimatic temperature reconstructions during the Holocene present secular to millennial oscillations. The millennial oscillation was responsible for the cooling observed from the Medieval Warm Period (900-1400) to the Little Ice Age (1400-1800) and, on average, could have caused about 50% of the warming observed since 1850. The finding implies an equilibrium climate sensitivity of 1.0-2.3 degrees C for CO2 doubling likely centered around 1.5 degrees C. This low sensitivity to radiative forcing agrees with the conclusions of recent studies. Semi-empirical models since 1000 A.D. are developed using 13 identified harmonics (representing the natural variability of the climate system) and a climatic function derived from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) model ensemble mean simulation (representing the mean greenhouse gas-GHG, aerosol, and volcano temperature contributions) scaled under the assumption of an equilibrium climate sensitivity of 1.5 degrees C. The harmonic model is evaluated using temperature data from 1850 to 2013 to test its ability to predict the major temperature patterns observed in the record from 2014 to 2020. In the short, medium, and long time scales the semi-empirical models predict: (1) temperature maxima in 2015-2016 and 2020, which is confirmed by the 2014-2020 global temperature record; (2) a relatively steady global temperature from 2000 to 2030-2040; (3) a 2000-2100 mean projected global warming of about 1 degrees C. The semi-empirical model reconstructs accurately the historical surface temperature record since 1850 and hindcasts mean surface temperature proxy reconstructions since the medieval period better than the model simulation that is unable to simulate the Medieval Warm Period.","2021-02","2023-09-26 16:11:47","2023-09-26 16:11:47","","","","2","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000622112800001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;11<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;11<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;156</p>","","","global climate change; EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; ATLANTIC MULTIDECADAL OSCILLATION; CYCLES; climate change forecast; climate oscillations; HARMONIC MODEL; harmonic models; NATURAL CLIMATE VARIABILITY; NORTHERN-HEMISPHERE TEMPERATURES; PLANETARY; RECORDS; RESOLUTION COHERENCE ANALYSIS; TOTAL SOLAR IRRADIANCE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study found out that the CCAPs are implemented in various forms including public education, land management, and water delivery. Moreover, about half of the Climate Change Adaptation Programs outlined from 2013-to-date were not implemented at all and more than 70% have not been completely successful. Also, the implementation of the CCAPs was mainly hindered by inadequate funding. It is recommended that there should be an improvement in CCAPs financing. Also, the Ejisu Municipal Assembly should include all Climate Change Adaptation Programs in the Districts' Medium-Term Development Plan under various thematic areas.

Among the seasonal variations of the average AOD, spring shows a higher aerosol loading, particularly over Jodhpur (0.518) and Kota (0.518), and fall shows the least. In spring, these variations may be due to the meteorological conditions that bring a large quantity of dust and other types of aerosols in the atmosphere of Western India.

The operation rules were extracted by minimising vulnerability and maximising reliability indices under both conditions. The results showed that when considering a constant value of the reliability index (i.e. 80%), the rate of vulnerability changes in the multi-objective FFA (Moffa) is lower than that of the multi-objective HHO (Mohho) algorithm. Therefore, Moffa has performed better than the Mohho algorithm in the optimal operation of the Golestan dam reservoir under both baseline and climate change conditions. On the other hand, the comparison of the optimum rules obtained under the baseline and climate change conditions showed that supplying the water demands would be more concordant with the optimum rules under climate change conditions in both optimisation algorithms. Therefore, the Golestan dam reservoir could perform better under climate change conditions in the case of using both the mentioned algorithms.","2021-10","2023-09-26 16:11:47","2023-09-26 16:11:47","","251-264","","5","174","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000710163300005","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;23</p>","","","climate change; OPTIMIZATION; POLICY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, the new wave records observed since 2010 have been located spatially and temporally using a simple spatial analysis method, while the increases in maximum wave heights over the last decade have been estimated and mapped. This work was motivated by evidence pointed out by several authors concerning the influence of global climate change on the local climate in the Mediterranean Sea and by the increase in the number and intensity of wave storm events over recent years. Several exceptional storms have recently been observed along the Mediterranean coasts, including storm Adrian in 2018 and storm Gloria in 2020, which resulted in enormous damage along the French and Spanish coasts. The results of the present study reflect a worrying situation in large part of the WMed coasts. Most of the WMed basin experiences a significant increasing trend in the annual Max of SWH and WS with evident inter-seasonal variability that underlines the importance of multi-scale analysis to assess wind and wave trends. Since 2013, about half of the WMed coastline has experienced records in wave climate, not recorded at least since 1979, and several areas have experienced three successive records. Several WMed coasts are experiencing a worrying evolution of the wave climate, which requires a serious mobilisation to prevent probable catastrophic wave storms and ensure sustainable and economic development.","2022-03","2023-09-26 16:11:47","2023-09-26 16:11:47","","1899-1922","","5-6","58","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000713970600002","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;10<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;10<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;85</p>","","","Climate change; MODEL; PROJECTIONS; REANALYSIS; Climate change trends; Climate records; COASTAL REGIONS; Coastal storm; GLOBAL TRENDS; Mediterranean climate; PERFORMANCE EVALUATION; SARAL/ALTIKA; SPEED; VALIDATION; Wave climate; WAVEWATCH III","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While they are argued to be an important component of effective climate governance, few studies have systematically assessed their political influence. Using the UK Committee on Climate Change (CCC) as a case, this paper investigates how such bodies influence political debates on climate change. To do so, we build an original dataset of all CCC mentions in UK Parliamentary proceedings from 2008-2018. We find that CCC analysis is used by all major political parties, that its influence has grown over time and that it has influenced policy debates both within its statutory remit (carbon budgets) and more broadly (energy policy and flood defence spending). Furthermore, most politicians have been supportive of the CCC. They have utilized the information it produces to hold government accountable and to argue for more ambitious policy. We find little evidence that CCC analysis is politicized or that it merely functions as a 'legitimiser', providing justification for the government's pre-decided policy choices. Instead, we find that the CCC functions primarily as a knowledge broker, offering trusted information to policymakers, and at times as a policy entrepreneur. Overall, the CCC experience demonstrates that climate change advisory bodies can play a key role in climate governance. Key policy insights The information and analysis produced by the CCC is widely cited by Parliamentarians across the political spectrum and is often used as the technical basis for political arguments calling for greater ambition. CCC evidence has substantial influence in areas that are directly covered by its core statutory mandate, but also wider climate change-related Parliamentary debates, indicating knowledge spillovers. The UK experience shows that an expert advisory body can strengthen climate governance by serving as an impartial knowledge broker, contributing to more evidence-based and ambitious policymaking.","2021-10-21","2023-09-26 16:11:46","2023-09-26 16:11:46","","1218-1233","","9","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000615833800001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;43</p>","","","Climate change advisory bodies; climate change governance; Committee on Climate Change; UK climate policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Individuals can give a substantial contribution even without waiting for the fullest activation of regulatory frameworks: our example shows that reductions of the individual emissions of about 20% are achievable without a drastic change in their habits. But more sub-stantial reductions beyond 20% require political decisions and investments that would 'enable' them to achieve them. Single individuals constitute a sort of immense ""climate innovation agent "", promoting the ever-wider growth and consolidation of a global public sphere, which must be capable of directing politics towards such changes, or, above all, facilitating the acceptance of measures in this direction and giving voice to systemic and effective criticisms, where such measu-res - which are now widely evident - are not or are too weakly adopted. Institutions and politics must support them in adopting the changes required to achieve net zero emissions. In this essay, it is first introduced the current state of the Earth's climate ( 1). Then, the key facts leading to the conclusion that human activities are the main cause of climate change are summa-rized, and the role that individual choices can lead to a reduction in emissions is analysed ( 2). There are several obstacles that must be overcome to reduce the emissions - many of a political nature above all - and the essay examines various risks of ineffectiveness that could constellate a path that is complex and full of old and new difficulties ( 3). The work carefully examines some proposals on the actual advantages that could occur if institutions enable individuals to decide for a global change in emission behaviours ( 4). A multifaceted strategy, aimed at directing the individual's motivation towards a global change in consumption behaviour and energy saving, can lead to the required change ( 5). Such a strategy requires immediate and effective policy actions at institutional level, to enable the structural change we need and which the ongoing climate change, mainly caused by man, requires us to implement.","2022","2023-09-26 16:11:46","2023-09-26 16:11:46","","323-348","","3","24","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000934072500017","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;34</p>","","","climate justice; CONSUMPTION; climate change ethics; climate change policy; individuals and climate change; Institutions and climate change","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The ability of a grass plant to recover from fire may be influenced by the fire frequency and intensity (influenced by seasonal weather conditions and fuel load), defoliation and competition from neighbouring plants. This study sought to investigate factors influencing the fire and herbivore dynamics of an evergreen C-3 grass, Festuca costata, in a high-altitude C-4 dominated grassland in the Drakensberg Mountains of South Africa. We experimentally examined the effect of fire frequency, defoliation and competition from neighbours on the growth dynamics of F. costata. Annual burning significantly decreased aboveground biomass production, number of tillers and tuft circumference of F. costata. Defoliation similarly reduced aboveground biomass production, number of tillers, tuft circumference and specific leaf area of F. costata. Competition from neighbouring plants reduced aboveground biomass production, number of tillers and tuft circumference of F. costata. Given the expected variable impacts of increasing CO2 levels and temperature on C-3 and C-4 grasses, these results provide insights for managing the matrix of C-3 and C-4 grasses in the Drakensberg grasslands in a changing climate.","2022-04-03","2023-09-26 16:12:01","2023-09-26 16:12:01","","222-229","","2","39","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000647973600001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;53</p>","","","climate change; SCALE; VEGETATION; RESPONSES; REGIMES; biodiversity; CATALONIA; FIRE FREQUENCY; herbivory; PLANT DIVERSITY; SOUTH-AFRICAN; TEMPERATE GRASSLANDS; TRAITS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Area changes and latitude and elevation shifts of Koppen climate zones have been examined based on the observed and projected datasets. This review article provides a comprehensive insight into the changes in global Koppen climate zones. First, we summarize the advancements and limitations of different climate zone definitions and assess the available climate classification map products. We then review recent detection and assessment studies on observed and projected climate zone changes. Finally, we summarize the findings of the previous studies. It has been proven that changes in climate zones under global warming can have far-reaching impacts on ecological systems. Since the 1980s, anthropogenic accelerated global warming has already led to shifts in climatic conditions over a large land area. Hot tropics and arid climates are projected to expand into large areas of middle and high latitudes, an expansion that is potentially linked to the intensification of the global hydrologic cycle. Driven by increased warming in the Arctic, high-latitude climates will shift poleward and upward, leading to a significant area shrinkage of the polar climate zones. However, due to the large model uncertainties, the detectability of significant climate zone changes through observations and projections, the rate and time of the changes, and their causes remain unclear. In this paper, we identify the research gaps and propose directions for future research.

It is expected that China will become the world leader in terms of installed offshore wind energy capacity in the upcoming years. A multi model ensemble of eight simulations from CORDEX project was considered to evaluate future offshore wind energy projections along the Chinese coast under the RCP8.5 warming scenario. Furthermore, offshore wind energy resource was classified attending to the richness of the resource, stability of the resource, risk and economic factors. The reliability of the CORDEX multi-model ensemble was analyzed by comparing CORDEX wind speed with two different datasets: in-situ data from oceanic buoys and ERA5 database. A general wind power density decrease was observed for the near future and the far future. At seasonal scale, differences were found depending on the season. Thus, a clear reduction was projected during spring, whilst increases were observed in wide areas during winter or autumn. Regarding the classification of the future offshore wind energy resource for the upcoming decades, most of the Chinese coastal area was defined as good or excellent due to its high offshore wind energy richness that compensate the low values on stability of the resource and risk factor.

Importantly, this result holds for internal and international migrants. These findings suggest the importance of humanitarian considerations and empathy in shaping migration attitudes. We use a follow-up factorial experiment to explore potential policy implications of public support for climate migrants.

The median day of the storm season shifts earlier by an average of one week in all three models in both hemispheres. Two of the three models' LGM simulations feature a reduction in storm count and global power dissipation index compared to the current climate, but a third shows no significant difference between the two climates. Although each model is forced by the same global changes, differences in the way sea surface temperatures and other large-scale environmental conditions respond in the North Atlantic impart significant differences in the climatology at LGM between models.

However, few studies have quantified the health impact of climate change in Brazil and in the Latin America region. In this paper, we projected the impacts of temperature on cardiovascular (CVD) mortality according to two climate change scenarios and two regionalized climate model simulations in Brazilian cities. Methods: We estimated the temperature-CVD mortality relationship in 21 Brazilian cities, using distributed lag non-linear models in a two-stage time-series analysis. We combined the observed exposure-response functions with the daily temperature projected under two representative concentration pathways (RCP), RCP8.5 and RCP4.5, and two regionalized climate model simulations, Eta-HadGEM2-ES and Eta-MIROC5. Results: We observed a trend of reduction in mortality related to low temperatures and a trend of increase in mortality related to high temperatures, according to all the investigated models and scenarios. In most places, the increase in mortality related to high temperatures outweighed the reduction in mortality related to low temperatures, causing a net increase in the excess temperature-related mortality. These trends were steeper according to the higher emission scenario, RCP8.5, and to the Eta-HadGEM2-ES model. According to RCP8.5, our projections suggested that the temperature-related mortality fractions in 2090-99 compared to 2010-2019 would increase by 8.6% and 1.7%, under Eta-HadGEM2-ES and Eta-MIROC5, respectively. According to RCP4.5, these values would be 0.7% and -0.6%. Conclusions: For the same climate model, we observed a greater increase trend in temperature-CVD mortality according to RCP8.5, highlighting a greater health impact associated with the higher emission scenario. Our results may be useful to support public policies and strategies for mitigation of and adaptation to climate change, particularly in the health sector.","2021-06","2023-09-26 16:12:00","2023-09-26 16:12:00","","","","","197","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000663717700006","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;40</p>","","","Climate change; Temperature; Climate projections; COLD; EPIDEMIOLOGY; Health impacts","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Holdridge life zones system is a land classification based on simple bioclimatic variables that can be used for evaluating the potential effect of future climates on ecosystems. However, information on future bioclimatic changes in ecoregions of southern South America is too coarse, or unavailable. Our main goals were to evaluate the usefulness of a simple bioclimatic classification system to assess the potential effects of climate change on ecological systems, and to what extent such changes would affect the ecoregions of Argentina. We analysed the multivariate distance between ecoregions of Argentina based on the area occupied by each life zone in each ecoregion and conducted an ordination of ecoregions under current and future climate scenarios. We also evaluated the correspondence between the boundaries of ecoregions and life zones. Overall, the ecoregions of Argentina are expected to face substantial change in bioclimatic conditions. In particular, ecoregions at high latitudes (e.g. Bosques Patagonicos) or altitudes (e.g. Altos Andes) are projected to exhibit similar bioclimatic conditions to ecoregions at lower latitudes or altitudes under current climate (e.g. Estepa Patagonica, Puna). The boundaries of ecoregions tended to coincide with those of life zones only in two cases and partial coincidence was the most frequent result. Further, the analysis of uncertainties of local climate data allowed to identify ecoregions where the results might be less reliable. Our study provides insights to improve conservation planning and management in Argentina. Integrating ecoregions and Holdridge life zones proved to be a useful approach for understanding the potential effects of future climate changes on ecological systems.","2022-05","2023-09-26 16:12:00","2023-09-26 16:12:00","","580-589","","3","47","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000736636300001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;52</p>","","","climate change; VARIABILITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DIVERSITY; DYNAMICS; IMPACTS; MODELS; RANGE; SURFACES; climate-ecosystems; FORESTS; land classification; planning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In response, climatologists and engineers have been developing climate-engineering technology to directly intervene on the climate through strategies such as solar radiation management and carbon dioxide removal. While these technologies have some encouraging features, they also involve risk on many dimensions. One behavioral risk that concerns many observers is the possibility that the prominence of climate-engineering scenarios could decrease the public's commitment to mitigation, a concern variously described as moral hazard or weakened resolve. Across 8 experiments (N = 2514) we tested whether exposure to naturalistic information about climateengineering technology decreases individuals' commitment to mitigation efforts.

The change of climate was built using the CORDEX, RCM daily precipitation, maximum and minimum temperature under RCP4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. The climate model was examined in the historical period 1996-2015 for its ability of capturing observed precipitation and temperature. Bias correction was performed on RCM temperature and precipitation to minimize the uncertainties that may occur from climate model projection. After the successful calibration and validation of the HBV hydrological model, streamflow was simulated for the periods of 2021-2040 and 2041-2060 and compared to streamflow of the baseline period 1996-2015 to investigate the changes. The results suggested that overall, following the precipitation increment, streamflow is expected to increase under both RCPs. The average monthly changes of streamflow are expected to increase by 40.1 and 29.4% under RCP4.5 and 16.9 and 18.5% under RCP8.5 scenarios for 2021-2040 and 2041-2060, respectively. Annual streamflow would increase by 28.5 and 23.95% under RCP4.5 and 8.5 respectively. The results of this work can help and inform the water resources planner and designer to frame an appropriate plan and management for the effective use of water in the future.","2022-02","2023-09-26 16:11:59","2023-09-26 16:11:59","","607-628","","2","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000718909400001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;8<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;9<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;39</p>","","","climate change; RIVER-BASIN; BIAS CORRECTION; climate model; bias-correction; climate scenarios; streamflow","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Warmer and drier than the upper Colorado River basin, with less snow and a bimodal precipitation regime, the Gila River is controlled by a set of climatic conditions that is different from the controls on upper Colorado River flow. Unlike the Colorado River at Lees Ferry in Arizona, the upper Gila River and major Gila River tributaries, the Salt and Verde Rivers, do not yet reflect significant declines in annual streamflow, despite warming trends. Annual streamflow is dominated by cool-season precipitation, but the monsoon influence is discernable as well, variable across the basin and complicated by an inverse relationship with cool-season precipitation in the Salt and Verde River basins. Major multiyear streamflow droughts in these two basins have frequently been accompanied by wet monsoons, suggesting that monsoon precipitation may partially offset the impacts of a dry cool season. While statistically significant trends in annual streamflow are not evident, decreases in autumn and spring streamflow reflect warming temperatures and some decreases in spring precipitation. Because climatic controls vary with topography and the influence of the monsoon, the impact of warming on streamflow in the three subbasins is somewhat variable. However, given relationships between climate and streamflow, current trends in hydroclimate, and projections for the future, it would be prudent to expect declines in Gila River water supplies in the coming decades. Significance StatementThis research investigates the climatic controls on the Gila River and its major tributaries, the Verde and Salt Rivers, to gain insights on how trends in climate may impact future water supply. The Gila River is the major tributary of the lower Colorado River, but, unlike the situation for the upper Colorado River, no significant decreasing trends in annual streamflow are evident despite warming temperatures. Climate-streamflow relationships are more complex in this part of the Colorado River basin, and several factors may be buffering streamflow to the impact of warming. However, given the key climatic controls on streamflow, current and emerging trends in climate, and projections for the future, declines in streamflow should be expected in the future.","2022-01","2023-09-26 16:11:59","2023-09-26 16:11:59","","1-14","","1","26","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000860481500001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;52</p>","","","TEMPERATURE; TRENDS; VARIABILITY; DROUGHT; Climate change; PRECIPITATION; SNOW; PATTERNS; Climate variability; Drought; FLOW; NORTH-AMERICAN MONSOON; Streamflow; Watersheds","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The poor infrastructure and low adaptation capabilities of these nations are the prime concern of current studies. Pakistan is vulnerable to climate-induced hazards including floods, droughts, water shortages, shifts in weather patterns, loss of biodiversity, melting of glaciers, and more in the coming years. For marginal societies dependent on natural resources, adaptation becomes a challenge and the utmost priority. Within the above context, this study was designed to fill the existing research gap concerning public knowledge of climate vulnerabilities and respective adaptation strategies in the northern Hindukush-Himalayan region of Pakistan. Using the stratified sampling technique, 25 union councils (wards) were selected from the nine tehsils (sub-districts) of the study area. Using the quantitative method approach, structured questionnaires were employed to collect data from 396 respondents. The study reveals varying public perceptions about different factors contributing to the causes and impacts of climate change and the sources of information in the three zones of the study area. The primary causes of climate change are deforestation, industrial waste, anthropogenic impurities, natural causes, and the burning of fossil fuels exacerbated by increased population. Changes in temperature, erratic rainfalls, floods, droughts, receding glaciers, and extreme weather events are some of the impacts observed over the past decades. While limiting the indiscriminate use of fossil fuels combined with government-assisted rehabilitation of forests can help combat climate change, the lack of proper education and economic, social, and governance barriers are hindering the local adaptation strategies. In addition, reduce environmental pollution (air, water, soil, etc.) and plantation polluted areas with suitable plants, are the two main actions in combating climate change. This study recommends policy interventions to enhance local adaptation efforts through building capacity, equipping local environmental institutions, discouraging deforestation, and ensuring sustainable use of natural resources.","2021-04","2023-09-26 16:11:59","2023-09-26 16:11:59","","","","8","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000645316400001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;76</p>","","","ADAPTATION; climate change; TRENDS; climate adaptation; COMMUNITIES; IMPACTS; KNOWLEDGE; EXTREME WEATHER; BARRIERS; climate vulnerability; climate-induced hazards; DEFORESTATION; EXPERIENCE; FARMER PERCEPTIONS; public perception","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While ascertaining a system to address the crisis can be daunting, integrated approaches, such as those that use technology, are fundamental to identifying and evaluating options for sustainable solutions. This paper explores the water-climate nexus through the case study of Chennai, the capital city of the state of Tamil Nadu in India. Climate change has influenced the behaviour and patterns of floods, brought about incessant rain and led to a shift in the monsoons. In addition, changes to the climate have resulted in a shortage of drinking water in Chennai. There is a concomitant problem of a large and increasing population. These elements warrant a discourse on law, humans and technology. In Chennai, the indifference and denial of political leaders have resulted in failure, and unsustainable measures to address the water crisis have been implemented. The intervention of the Supreme Court of India relating to a mechanism to deal with a water-sharing arrangement between the states of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka in the last few decades has been unsuccessful. None of the proposed solutions were based on incorporating technology, which is a major oversight. The resultant consequences of water use and the complex mix of social factors surrounding the vulnerable population are addressed in this paper. The effect of the water crisis on women and the agricultural workforce is illustrated to argue for greater and more 'imaginative governmental intervention. The paper concludes with a discussion of the need for a holistic approach to climate change and the ongoing water crisis that invites better interventions, particularly in terms of technology, to address the crisis and avoid a situation in which groundwater will be critically degraded by 2030.","2022","2023-09-26 16:11:59","2023-09-26 16:11:59","","79-101","","1","4","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000892027000005","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;173</p>","","","INDIA; Climate change; climate emergency; SCARCITY; India; water management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nevertheless, achieving food security in the face of climate change seems to be unachievable in the foreseeable future. The study sought to investigate the coverage by newspapers in Zimbabwe on food security issues related to climate-smart agriculture. Quantitative data on food security issues were collected by reviewing newspapers namely The Herald, Newsday, The Standard and The Sunday Mail in 123 days. The main objective was to analyse quantitative coverage of climate-smart agricultural news. The study analysed newspaper coverage of crop production, animal production, fisheries, postharvest management, food safety, value addition, marketing and administration as they relate to climate change. Results of 469 food security articles revealed that 22.6% coverage was related to climate change whilst 77.4% covered food security issues not related to climate change. The study concluded that there was a significant variance in the coverage of various food security issues related to climate change with climate change issues related to postharvest management, food safety and fishery management not being covered during the period of study. It is recommended that stakeholders in the agriculture sector and the media industry should work towards improving the publication of climate change adaptation and mitigation in agriculture.","2021-01-01","2023-09-26 16:11:59","2023-09-26 16:11:59","","","","1","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000653993600001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;22</p>","","","Climate change; IMPACTS; newspaper coverage; climate-smart agriculture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain this weakening. In order to isolate and assess their relative importance, we here use the abrupt 4 x CO2 experiment of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5, as this forcing separates the different mechanisms which respond on different time scales. We find that the Hadley circulation responds relatively quickly to quadrupling CO2 concentrations, reaching its steady-state value after less than a decade. This fast response demonstrates that the weakening could not be solely due to the much slower increase in surface temperature. In addition, we show that the Hadley cell's weakening results from a combination of an increase in tropical static stability, partially offset by an increase in the latitudinal gradient of latent heating.","2021-02-16","2023-09-26 16:11:59","2023-09-26 16:11:59","","","","3","48","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000620058900075","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;9<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;9<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;28</p>","","","climate change; Hadley cell","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During these participatory community workshops, participants addressed the potential changes in the spatial distribution of fishery resources, the loss of ocean productivity, the increase in sea level, and higher storm frequency. The adaptation measures proposed to reduce vulnerability to these climate change effects can be grouped in three categories: 1) economic diversification, 2) improvement in the processing and commercialization of fishery products, and 3) fisheries management. Some of the key adaptation measures included diversification of fishing activities, processing and marketing, and improving fisheries management. In general, Mexico has the comprehensive policy framework necessary to implement these measures, but requires financing and a more efficient regulatory process that can respond to the rapid effects of climate change in marine systems.","2021-12","2023-09-26 16:11:59","2023-09-26 16:11:59","","","","","134","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000708017400012","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;70</p>","","","Climate change; Adaptation; Fisheries; CONSERVATION; EL VIZCAINO; GULF-OF-CALIFORNIA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During this population expansion, human and natural selection, together with demographic events, molded the livestock genome leading to local breeds and populations able to produce milk, meat, wool and tractive power in many different agro-climatic conditions. The climate is changing, with temperatures and the frequency of extreme climatic events increasing, which affects livestock welfare and production efficiency, particularly of the highly productive breeds. Genomics is now able to explore the DNA of local breeds adapted to extreme environments in search of genes carrying signatures of selection for adaptation. This review summarizes methods used to accomplish this task, giving examples of results achieved and perspectives for future breeding.</p> <br></p> Livestock radiated out from domestication centres to most regions of the world, gradually adapting to diverse environments, from very hot to sub-zero temperatures and from wet and humid conditions to deserts. The climate is changing; generally global temperature is increasing, although there are also more extreme cold periods, storms, and higher solar radiation. These changes impact livestock welfare and productivity. This review describes advances in the methodology for studying livestock genomes and the impact of the environment on animal production, giving examples of discoveries made. Sequencing livestock genomes has facilitated genome-wide association studies to localize genes controlling many traits, and population genetics has identified genomic regions under selection or introgressed from one breed into another to improve production or facilitate adaptation. Landscape genomics, which combines global positioning and genomics, has identified genomic features that enable animals to adapt to local environments. Combining the advances in genomics and methods for predicting changes in climate is generating an explosion of data which calls for innovations in the way big data sets are treated. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are now being used to study the interactions between the genome and the environment to identify historic effects on the genome and to model future scenarios.</p>","2021-10","2023-09-26 16:11:59","2023-09-26 16:11:59","","","","10","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000712756200001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;10<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;10<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;271</p>","","","climate change; R PACKAGE; adaptation; CANDIDATE LOCI; CATTLE; EXTREMES INDEXES; GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; HEAT-STRESS; LANDSCAPE GENOMICS; livestock; LOCAL ADAPTATION; POPULATION-GENETICS; POSITIVE SELECTION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

People with ""individualist-hierarchical"" values favor individual freedom, competition, and clearly defined social hierarchies, while ""communitarian-egalitarians"" value interdependence and equality across gender, age, heritage, and ethnicity. In the US, individualist-hierarchs generally perceive less risk from climate change and express lower support for actions to mitigate it than communitarian-egalitarians. Exposure to scientific information does little to change these views. Here, we ask if a widely used experiential simulation, World Climate, can help overcome these barriers. World Climate combines an engaging role-play with an interactive computer model of the climate system. We examine pre- and post-World Climate survey responses from 2,080 participants in the US and use a general linear mixed model approach to analyze interactions among participants' sociopolitical values and gains in climate change knowledge, affect, and intent to take action. As expected, prior to the simulation, participants holding individualist-hierarchical values had lower levels of climate change knowledge, felt less urgency, and expressed lower intent to act than those holding communitarian-egalitarian values. However, individualist-hierarchs made significantly larger gains across all constructs, particularly urgency, than communitarian-egalitarians. Participants' sociopolitical values also shifted: those with individualistic-hierarchical values before the simulation showed a substantial, statistically significant shift toward a communitarian-egalitarian worldview. Simulation-based experiences like World Climate may help reduce polarization and build consensus towards science-based climate action.","2021-12","2023-09-26 16:11:59","2023-09-26 16:11:59","","","","12","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000734379200004","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;51</p>","","","SCIENCE; CHANGE ADAPTATION; CHINA; SUPPORT; climate change communication; EMOTION; POLARIZATION; polarization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To achieve this, a survey was used with various actors based on the first National Survey of Public Perception of Climate Change. The results show that the respondents perceive that the availability and quality of water are indeed highly threatened by climate change. As actions for adaptation, they suggested the promotion of the protection of hydrographic basins and a greater control of dumping liquids into surface water sources. Finally, they requested increased opportunities to improve water governance and participation in decision-making bodies regarding climate change, which they see as a fundamental aspect to achieve a real climate empowerment that can lead to action and adaptation in the territories in emerging countries.","2022-01","2023-09-26 16:11:58","2023-09-26 16:11:58","","43-55","","1","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000692782500001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;50</p>","","","climate change; water; governance; climate empowerment; perception","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The recorded temperatures have often been described as ""abnormal and anomalous"", according to a statement made by scientists working at the Antarctic bases. Since polar regions have shown the most rapid rates of climate change in recent years, this abnormality is of primary interest in the context of vulnerability of the Antarctic to climate changes. Using data detected at different Antarctic bases, we investigate yearly maxima and minima of recorded temperatures, in order to establish whether they can be considered as usual extreme events or abnormal.

Change in near-surface temperature, precipitation, evapotranspiration, integrated water vapour transport (IVT), sea level pressure (SLP), and wind at three pressure levels is quantified across the multi-model suite. Additionally, model agreement for the sign and significance of projected change is assessed within the ensemble. Models are in strong agreement that the highest magnitude of projected warming will be over tropical regions. The CMIP5 models project a decrease in precipitation for all seasons over southern South America, especially along the northern portions of the present-day mid-latitude storm track. This is consistent with a robustly projected poleward shift of the Pacific extratropical high-pressure system and mid-latitude storm track indicated by a systematic increase in SLP and decrease in westerly wind magnitude over the region. Decreased precipitation for the months of September, October, and November is also projected, with strong model agreement, over portions of northern and northeastern Brazil, coincident with decreases in SLP and increases in evapotranspiration. IVT is broadly projected to decrease over southern South America, coincident with the projected poleward shift of the mid-latitude storm track, with increases projected in the vicinity of the South Atlantic Convergence Zone in spring and summer.

Many climate decision support tools (DSTs) have been developed to support decision-making across a variety of sectors and scales, but evaluation of such tools has only recently begun to take place. This study conducted a summative evaluation of the utility of a decision-maker-driven climate hazard assessment tool, the Simple Planning Tool (SPT), a climate DST. The SPT was inspired by and codeveloped with emergency managers, planners, and a boundary organization in two south-central U.S. states. The SPT's target audience was surveyed to assess the tool's utility, including its saliency, credibility, trustworthiness, and reasons for and impact of information use on decision-making. A high utility was found despite a relatively limited user base at the time of the study. In addition, SPT users represented a range of jurisdictional sizes, geographical scales, and years of experience. Although the small user sample limits generalizability of the study, it is likely a realistic reflection of the number of emergency managers and planners in the two states who are actively and regularly incorporating climate hazards into planning. The data also indicate that climate boundary organizations and climate service providers should work toward utilizing trusted information sources, channels, and procedures within the sectors to which their tool applies to help increase decision-maker awareness and use of their tool. Significance StatementA Simple Planning Tool (SPT) for Oklahoma and Arkansas climate hazards was developed in response to needs identified by planners and emergency managers in two states. This study evaluated the usefulness and impact of the SPT about one year after it became available and adds to the limited body of literature on climate decision support tool evaluation. The evaluation showed that that tool was useful and informed plans, but for a limited user base. Climate decision support tool communicators can help raise awareness of their tool(s) by utilizing existing decision-maker trusted information channels. They should also recognize that the full impact of their tool may not be known for several years, especially within the context of long-range planning.","2021-01","2023-09-26 16:11:58","2023-09-26 16:11:58","","147-157","","1","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000665787800012","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;48</p>","","","Climate change; Climate services; INFORMATION; SCIENCE; KNOWLEDGE; Climate variability; SUPPORT; COPRODUCTION; Decision support; IMPROVE; NEEDS; Planning; USABILITY; WEATHER FORECASTS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, green roof research and maintenance awareness in Malaysia are comparatively scarce, largely due to the absence of local tropical green roof guidelines. Therefore, this paper aims to explore current green roof maintenance practices and challenges for non-residential buildings in Malaysia through case studies and in-depth interviews. These results were then compared with three international green roof guidelines, namely those of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyor, Singapore's National Parks Board, and the US Environmental Protection Agency. The findings show that current green roof maintenance elements implemented in the case studies are insufficient and inadequate for Malaysia's tropical climate conditions. The paper recommends nine (9) green roof maintenance elements specific for non-residential buildings in Malaysia and the tropical climate: plant selection, rainwater harvesting system, pest control, monitoring performance, accessibility, irrigation cleaning, waterproofing membrane maintenance, plants and growing medium, and maintenance of outdoor furniture. As this paper has only included data from Kuala Lumpur, this limits the generalizability of the findings to other buildings in Malaysia and a tropical climate. The implications of this study may provide further direction for researchers to consider a larger sample size and other cities in a tropical climate. This study will allow policymakers and building stakeholders to develop suitable green roof maintenance guidelines.","2022-02","2023-09-26 16:11:58","2023-09-26 16:11:58","","2471-2496","","2","24","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000656820700002","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;67</p>","","","Climate change; IMPACT; PERFORMANCE; BENEFITS; Green roof; IMPLEMENTATION; Maintenance; Tropical climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition, solar geoengineering is being considered as a potential tool to offset warming, especially to limit temperature until negative emissions technologies are sufficiently matured (MacMartin et al., 2018). Despite this, there has been a reluctance to embrace carbon removal and solar geoengineering, partly due to the perception that these technologies represent what is widely termed a ""moral hazard"": that geoengineering will prevent people from developing the will to change their personal consumption and push for changes in infrastructure (Robock et al., 2010), erode political will for emissions cuts (Keith, 2007), or otherwise stimulate increased carbon emissions at the social-system level of analysis (Bunzl, 2008). These debates over carbon removal and geoengineering echo earlier ones over climate adaptation.

It is unknown whether these observed phenological shifts are sufficient to keep pace with rapid climate changes. Phenological mismatch, or the desynchronization between the timing of critical phenological events, has long been hypothesized but rarely quantified on a large scale. It is even less clear how human activities have contributed to this emergent phenological mismatch. In this study, we used remote sensing observations to systematically evaluate how plant phenological shifts have kept pace with warming trends at the continental scale. In particular, we developed a metric of spatial mismatch that connects empirical spatiotemporal data to ecological theory using the ""velocity of change"" approach. In northern mid-to high-latitude regions (between 30-70 degrees N) over the last three decades (1981-2014), we found evidence of a widespread mismatch between land surface phenology and climate where isolines of phenology lag behind or move in the opposite direction to the isolines of climate. These mismatches were more pronounced in human-dominated landscapes, suggesting a relationship between human activities and the desynchronization of phenology dynamics with climate variations. Results were corroborated with independent ground observations that indicate the mismatch of spring phenology increases with human population density for several plant species. This study reveals the possibility that not even some of the foremost responses in vegetation activity match the pace of recent warming. This systematic analysis of climate-phenology mismatch has important implications for the sustainable management of vegetation in human-dominated landscapes under climate change.","2021-12","2023-09-26 16:11:58","2023-09-26 16:11:58","","","","4","2","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000736630100001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;8<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;8<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;85</p>","","","climate change; TRENDS; VEGETATION; global change; phenology; DYNAMICS; IMPACTS; Anthropocene; SHIFTS; AUTUMN; climate-phenology mismatch; land use; LAND-SURFACE PHENOLOGY; PATTERN; URBANIZATION; VELOCITY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Eighteen indicators based on climate and climate-related variables were used to provide an assessment, in the form of an index, of how livable a city is depending on prevailing climatic conditions. The resulting index can also be used to investigate how recent and future changes in the climatic conditions could affect livability. All Chinese cities and regions share the common goals of promoting low-carbon development, improving resilience against climate change, and integrating economic growth with climate actions. Climate services have been developed in China to provide decision-makers this measure of livability.

The results of our study indicated that progressive climate change affecting forest ecosystems is clearly felt by the professional group related to forests such as foresters, and to a lesser extent by people using forests for tourism and recreation. According to foresters, the effects of climate change on forest areas include rapid changes in weather patterns and more frequent insect infestations. On the other hand, people resting in forests mainly observe the lack of snow cover and occurrence of drought. Informal forest education insufficiently covers the topic of climate change.

Climate has been suggested as a crucial filter of invasion-driven homogenization of biodiversity. However, it remains unclear which climatic factors drive the assemblage of alien species. Here, we compiled global data at both grid scale (2,653 native and 2,806 current grids with a resolution of 2 degrees x 2 degrees) and administrative scale (271 native and 297 current nations and sub-nations) on the distributions of 361 alien amphibians and reptiles (herpetofauna), the most threatened vertebrate group on the planet. We found that geographical distance, a proxy for natural dispersal barriers, was the dominant variable contributing to alien herpetofaunal assemblage in native ranges. In contrast, climatic factors explained more unique variation in alien herpetofaunal assemblage after than before invasions. This pattern was driven by extremely high temperatures and precipitation seasonality, 2 hallmarks of global climate change, and bilateral trade which can account for the alien assemblage after invasions. Our results indicated that human-assisted species introductions combined with climate change may accelerate the reorganization of global species distributions.","2021-08","2023-09-26 16:11:57","2023-09-26 16:11:57","","393-402","","4","67","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000684065200004","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;67</p>","","","climate change; FRAMEWORK; RISK; HOMOGENIZATION; climate variability; climate extremes; REGIONS; SHIFTS; BETA-DIVERSITY; biogeography; biological invasion; BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS; GEOGRAPHICAL RANGE; RICHNESS; TOLERANCE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The paper at hand is part of a special report on tourism, which has been developed by leading research institutions in Austria supported by selected experts and stakeholders. Research and communication needs are addressed including the need for climate risk assessments for businesses, research on tipping points in tourism demand as well as opportunities for non snow related tourism products and needs of non-skiers. As evidence on the sector's contribution to CO2 in Austria is scarce, better knowledge of the status quo and monitoring is required.","2021-06","2023-09-26 16:11:57","2023-09-26 16:11:57","","","","","34","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000697164700006","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;14<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;14<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;109</p>","","","ADAPTATION; Climate change; IMPACT; Adaptation; EVOLUTION; MANAGEMENT; Mitigation; SCENARIOS; TOURISM; ARTIFICIAL SNOW PRODUCTION; Austria; Contribution to climate change; ONTARIO; SKIERS; SNOWMAKING; Winter tourism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, institutions like the World Bank are positioning themselves for a transformation in adaptation finance, seeking to provide substantially more adaptation finance as distinct from financial support for greenhouse gas mitigation. This article explores the recent emergence of adaptation as a higher priority and how a longer-term time horizon is necessary if a transformation in climate change governance is to occur which places greater emphasis on sustainable development goals relating to improvement of circumstances of citizens in the most climate-vulnerable nations, mostly in the Global South. The article also considers the important debate in the climate change policy literature over the extent to which funds supporting adaptation are going to lower-income nations or people, as might be anticipated given the view that the poor are more vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change. Data linking World Bank project funding to climate change adaptation and mitigation, derived from a keyword-matching approach, show that from 2010 to 2018, the share of climate-change-related finance devoted to adaptation in World Bank projects increased considerably. The data indicate that adaptation funding tends to be directed more to more climate-vulnerable nations and those with greater state fragility, but not to low-income countries versus high-income countries. Implications are considered for how this change might be ""scaled up "" to achieve a transformational status.","2021-10","2023-09-26 16:11:57","2023-09-26 16:11:57","","","","19","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000707899600001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;36</p>","","","climate change; climate adaptation; climate finance; adaptation finance; climate finance gap; DAMAGE; international lenders; PARIS; transformational change; World Bank","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This research investigates whether local urban planning policies in master plans target climate change mitigation and adaptation. Accordingly, this research undertook a qualitative content analysis of the policy framework of master plans that are involved in the sample and developed climate change mitigation indexes for all the sampled master plans by assessing urban policies against climate change mitigation evaluation protocols. This research significantly contributes to the field of urban planning and public policy by developing empirical evidence that analyzes the relationship between urban planning policies and climate change mitigation and adaptation. This research supports the use of master plans as an effective tool in mitigating and adapting to climate change and has an implication for mainstreaming climate change mitigation and adaptation in urban planning.","2022-01","2023-09-26 16:11:57","2023-09-26 16:11:57","","156-181","","1","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000797345800008","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;63</p>","","","HABITAT; ENVIRONMENT; climate change adaptation; CONSERVATION; climate change mitigation; integration; PLANS; policy framework; urban planning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This heterogeneous trend pattern departs from comparatively uniform observed increases in precipitable water over the contiguous United States. Here we use an event attribution framework involving parallel sets of global atmospheric model experiments with and without climate change drivers to explain this spatially diverse pattern of extreme daily precipitation trends. We find that RX1day events in our model ensembles respond to observed historical climate change forcing differently across the United States with 5%-10% intensity increases over the East but no appreciable change over the West. This spatially diverse forced signal is broadly similar among three models used, and is positively correlated with the observed trend pattern. Our analysis of model and observations indicates the lack of appreciable RX1day signals over the West is likely due to dynamical effects of climate change forcing-via a wintertime atmospheric circulation anomaly that suppresses vertical motion over the West-largely cancelling thermodynamic effects of increased water vapor availability. The large magnitude of eastern U.S. RX1day increases is unlikely a symptom of a regional heightened sensitivity to climate change forcing. Instead, our ensemble simulations reveal considerable variability in RX1day trend magnitudes arising from internal atmospheric processes alone, and we argue that the remarkable observed increases over the East has most likely resulted from a superposition of strong internal variability with a moderate climate change signal. Implications for future changes in U.S. extreme daily precipitation are discussed.","2021-04","2023-09-26 16:11:57","2023-09-26 16:11:57","","2759-2775","","7","34","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000644142700021","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;75</p>","","","TRENDS; Climate change; MODEL; CLIMATE; ATTRIBUTION; HIGH-RESOLUTION; Climate models; Precipitation; Extreme events; UNITED-STATES; Climate records; EL-NINO-LIKE; FLOOD RISK; PACIFIC-OCEAN; SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We use surveys conducted among the Finnish policymaking elite (n = 675) and a representative sample of the Finnish voting-age population (n = 1,701) in 2018-19, which included identical items of climate change concern and willingness to reduce personal living standards to curb climate change. Policymakers demonstrate much more concern for climate change and willingness to pay, suggesting a significant attitudinal disconnect between policymakers and citizens. The incongruence remains when taking personal income into account. In terms of party support, policymaker opinion aligns with opinions of voters of the green party in Finland. We speculate as to whether the observed opinion incongruence could restrict policymakers' possibilities to make climate-friendly policies and whether climate-skeptic populist parties could use it for political gain.","2022-04-16","2023-09-26 16:11:57","2023-09-26 16:11:57","","542-551","","3","31","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000695979600001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;22</p>","","","BELIEFS; climate change concern; Climate change opinion; policymaker opinion; willingness to pay","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we conduct a formal detection and attribution analysis on changes in four percentile-based precipitation extreme indices. The indices include annual precipitation totals from days with precipitation exceeding the 99th and 95th percentiles of wet-day precipitation in 1961-90 (R99p and R95p) and their contributions to annual total precipitation (R99pTOT and R95pTOT). We compare these indices from a set of newly compiled observations during 1951-2014 with simulations from models participating in phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). We show that most land areas with observations experienced increases in these extreme indices with global warming during the historical period 1951-2014. The new CMIP6 models are able to reproduce these overall increases, although with considerable over- or underestimations in some regions. An optimal fingerprinting analysis reveals detectable anthropogenic signals in the observations of these indices averaged over the globe and over most continents. Furthermore, signals of greenhouse gases can be separately detected, taking other forcing into account, over the globe and over Asia in these indices except for R95p. In contrast, signals of anthropogenic aerosols and natural forcings cannot be detected in any of these indices at either global or continental scales.","2021-02","2023-09-26 16:11:56","2023-09-26 16:11:56","","871-881","","3","34","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000615485100002","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;35<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;35<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;39</p>","","","TEMPERATURE; TRENDS; Climate change; Climate models; PART I; Climate variability; Rainfall; INDEXES; Anthropogenic effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Do climate change attitudes influence behaviour or is it possible that behaviour can change attitudes? This study uses a unique repeated survey dataset of 275 farmers (irrigators) in the southern Murray-Darling Basin from 2010-11 to 2015-16, to explore the dynamic relationship between climate change risk perceptions and farm adaptation behaviour. Farmers who had an increased risk exposure (expressed through higher debt, larger irrigated areas, greater share of permanent crops, and located in areas with higher temperatures and less rainfall) were more likely to agree climate change posed a risk. Whilst farmers became more accepting towards climate change over the time-period, a significant percentage of these attitudes were unstable. One reason suggested for this instability is the presence of a feedback loop between risk perceptions and behaviour. Namely, new evidence was found that farmers who agreed climate change was a risk in 2010-11, were more likely to undertake farm production decisions to reduce that risk (e.g. changing crop mix, reducing irrigated area and consequently selling water entitlements)-which had the impact of negatively feeding back and reducing their stated climate change risk perceptions in 2015-16. Conversely, farmers who were originally deniers were more likely to undertake somewhat riskier farm production decisions (e.g. increasing water utilisation rates and irrigation areas)-which consequently had the impact of positively increasing their climate change risk perceptions in 2015-16.","2021-05","2023-09-26 16:11:56","2023-09-26 16:11:56","","","","","68","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000653092800007","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;21<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;22<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;61</p>","","","ATTITUDES; Climate change attitudes; DETERMINANTS; RESPONSES; FUTURE; CHANGE BELIEFS; MITIGATION; CHANGE ADAPTATION; WATER; Climate change risk perception; Irrigators; IRRIGATORS; Murray-Darling Basin; RURAL NEVADA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Clayton & Karazsia (2020) recently developed the 22-item Climate Change Anxiety Scale (CAS), which assesses climate change anxiety via a four-factor structure. Yet other research has cast doubts on the very structure of the CAS by calling either for a shorter (i.e. 13 items) two-factor structure or for a shorter single-factor structure (i.e. 13 items). So far, these three different models have not yet been compared in one study. Moreover, uncertainty remains regarding the associations between the CAS and other psychological constructs, especially anxiety and depression. This project was designed to overcome these limitations. In a first preregistered study (n = 305), we translated the scale into French and tested, via confirmatory factor analyses (CFA), whether the French version would better fit with a four-, two-, or single-factor structure, as implied by previous works. We also examined how the CAS factors related to depression, anxiety, and environmental identity. In a second preregistered study, we aimed at replicating our comparison between the three CFA models in a larger sample (n = 905). Both studies pointed to a 13-item version of the scale with a two-factor structure as the best fitting model, with one factor reflecting cognitive and emotional features of climate change anxiety and the other reflecting the related functional impairments. Each factor exhibited a positive association with depression and environmental identity but not with general anxiety. We discuss how this two-factor structure impacts the conceptualization of climate change anxiety.","2022","2023-09-26 16:11:56","2023-09-26 16:11:56","","123-135","","1","62","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000777000700001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;11<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;11<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;58</p>","","","climate change; assessment; FIT INDEXES; climate change anxiety; COMMON; DISORDER; eco-anxiety; French validation; GAD-7; GRIEF; psychometrics; SAMPLE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Postcolonial theory's lens was applied to the review of the selected publications to highlight indigenous people's agency, despite IKSs' marginalization through colonial encounters and the ensuing epistemic violence. The categories of social adaptation, structural adaptation, and institutional adaptation emerged from the IKS-based climate change adaptation strategies described in the articles, with social adaptation being the most recurrent. We discussed how these strategies can be employed to decolonise climate change education through critical, place-based, participatory, and holistic methodologies.

As an alternative for conventional electricity systems, renewable energies are considered to be an important policy tool for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and therefore, they play an important role in climate change mitigation strategies. Renewable energies, however, may also play a crucial role in climate change adaptation strategies because they can reduce the vulnerability of energy systems to extreme events. The paper examines whether policy-makers in Israel tend to focus on mitigation strategies or on adaptation strategies in renewable energy policy discourse. The results indicate that despite Israel's minor impact on global greenhouse gas emissions, policy-makers focus more on promoting renewable energies as a climate change mitigation strategy rather than an adaptation strategy. These findings shed light on the important role of international influence-which tends to emphasize mitigation over adaptation-in motivating the domestic policy discourse on renewable energy as a coping method with climate change.","2021-03","2023-09-26 16:11:56","2023-09-26 16:11:56","","","","6","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000645828000001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;18<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;18<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;115</p>","","","ADAPTATION; climate change; RISK; CYCLE; CHANGE IMPACTS; MITIGATION; GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; adaptation; mitigation; POLITICS; climate change policy; energy policy; GENERATION; renewable energy; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; SYSTEMS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This mixed methods investigation combines salinity testing with qualitative research methods to explore these impacts in one of the most salinity-affected regions in the world-the Ganges River Delta. Data collection in 2015 and 2016 undertaken in Bangladesh's southwest coastal region and Dhaka consisted of 83 in-depth household and stakeholder interviews, six community focus groups, and salinity testing of 27 soil and 45 surface and groundwater samples. Results show that household food production is a multifaceted cornerstone of rural livelihood in the southwest coastal region, and virtually every component of it-from rice plantation and homestead gardening to livestock cultivation and aquaculture-is being negatively affected by salinity. Although households have attempted multiple strategies for adapting food production, effective adaptation remains elusive. At the community level, improved irrigation and floodplain management, as well as restrictions on saltwater aquaculture to abate salinity, are viewed as promising interventions. However, the potential of such measures remains unrealized on a broad scale, as they require a level of external resources and regulation not yet provided by the NGO and government sectors. This study elucidates issues of accessibility, equity, and governance surrounding agricultural interventions for climate change-related salinity adaptation, and its findings can help inform the community of organizations that will increasingly need to grapple with salinity in order to guarantee food security in the context of environmental change.","2022-02","2023-09-26 16:11:56","2023-09-26 16:11:56","","229-248","","1","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000679267700001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;12<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;12<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;79</p>","","","Climate change; CLIMATE-CHANGE; Climate change adaptation; FARMERS; Food security; ZONE; WATER MANAGEMENT; SYSTEMS; Bangladesh; GROUNDWATER QUALITY; INTRUSION; IRRIGATION; LIVELIHOOD CHOICES; Salinity; Saltwater intrusion; SHRIMP","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We discuss the potential strengths and limitations of evolutionary-based behavioral interventions and briefly reflect on outstanding research questions that can further the integration of evolutionary approaches into mainstream environmental psychology.","2021-12","2023-09-26 16:11:56","2023-09-26 16:11:56","","54-59","","","42","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000700610700010","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;12<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;12<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;72</p>","","","ADAPTATION; Climate change; FOOD; WILLINGNESS; Ancestral motivations; Climate change interventions; CUES; Evolutionary psychology; GREEN; Proenvironmental behavior; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; SUSTAINABLE BEHAVIOR","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is the primary way many individuals experience climate change, which has led researchers to investigate the influence of personal experience on climate change concern and action. However, existing evidence is still limited and in some cases contradictory. At the same time, behavioral decision research has highlighted the importance of pre-existing values and beliefs in shaping how individuals experience changes in environmental conditions. This is in line with theories of motivated reasoning, which suggest that people interpret and process information in a biased manner to maintain their prior beliefs. Yet, the evidence for directional motivated reasoning in the context of climate change beliefs has recently been questioned. In the current paper, we critically review the literature on the interrelationships between personal experience of local weather anomalies, extreme weather events and climate change beliefs. Overall, our review shows that there is some evidence that local warming can generate climate change concern, but the capacity for personal experience to promote action may rely upon the experience first being attributed to climate change. Rare extreme weather events will likely have limited impact on judgments and decisions unless they have occurred recently. However, even recent events may have limited impact among individuals who hold strong pre-existing beliefs rejecting the reality of climate change. We identify limitations of existing research and suggest directions for future work.","2021-07-02","2023-09-26 16:11:56","2023-09-26 16:11:56","","","","","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000674053200001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;19<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;19<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;67</p>","","","climate change; PREFERENCES; extreme weather; CHANGE MITIGATION; PUBLIC PERCEPTIONS; EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS; climate change beliefs; CONSEQUENCES; DAILY TEMPERATURE; LOCAL WEATHER; OVERESTIMATION; personal experience; prior beliefs; RARE EVENTS; RISK PERCEPTION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Indonesia, the Southeast Asian country in the tropical climate zone, the increasing heat wave duration due to climate change will be also magnified by projected rapid urbanization. Therefore, not only climate change mitigation measures but also adaptation solutions to more frequent extreme weather events are necessary. Adaptation is essential at local levels. The projected increase of the heat wave duration will trigger greater health-related risks. It will also drive higher energy demands, particularly in urban areas, for cooling. New smart solutions for growing urbanization for reducing urban heat island phenomenon are critical, but in order to identify them, analyzing the changing magnitude and spatial distribution of urban heat is essential. We projected the current and future spatial variability of heat stress index in three cities in Indonesia, namely, Medan, Surabaya, and Denpasar, under climate change and land-cover change scenarios, and quantified it with the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) for two periods, baseline (1981-2005) and future (2018-2042). Our results demonstrated that currently the higher level of the UTCI was identified in the urban centers of all three cities, indicating the contribution of urban heat island phenomenon to the higher UTCI. Under climate change scenarios, all three cities will experience increase of the heat, whereas applying the land-cover scenario demonstrated that in only Medan and Denpasar, the UTCI is likely to experience a higher increase by 3.1 degrees C; however, in Surabaya, the UTCI will experience 0.84 degrees C decrease in the period 2018-2042 due to urban greening. This study advanced the UTCI methodology by demonstrating its applicability for urban heat warning systems and for monitoring of the urban green cooling effect, as well as it provides a base for adaptation measures' planning.","2021-05-04","2023-09-26 16:11:55","2023-09-26 16:11:55","","","","","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000651498600001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;62</p>","","","HEALTH; land cover change; STRESS; climate change adaptation; CHINA; climate change scenario; urban green; urban heating; UTCI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The poultry sector is an important component of the African food system, but national climate change adaptation plans in many countries fail to take into account the specific contextual challenges faced by poultry producers. We developed a participatory system dynamics modelling tool to involve stakeholders from the poultry sector in Nigeria in analyzing how climate impacts would affect the sector, with the goal of generating insights for state (sub-national) and national scale policy makers. A second goal of the exercise was to facilitate social learning and knowledge sharing on adaptation strategies among the stakeholders. Given the high uncertainty of the conditions surrounding the Nigerian poultry sector, the model's use is primarily as a discussion tool for poultry sector stakeholders, including policy makers, to share concerns and develop adaptation strategies. It served this purpose, as evidenced by the creation of a manual for poultry producers from the exercise. Similar stakeholder engagement efforts can stimulate knowledge sharing around climate change adaptation for problems around which limited data and high uncertainty exist. Key policy insights Participatory system dynamics modelling is shown to be a useful tool for integrating national and community-level priorities for policy and management under climate change in the Nigerian poultry sector. Effective climate change adaptation will require building resilience to large-scale external drivers such as global trade dynamics, which are highly influential in the system. In order to effectively move from planning to implementation, climate change adaptation processes must facilitate social learning and knowledge sharing around the long-term consequences of policy and management choices.","2021-05-28","2023-09-26 16:11:55","2023-09-26 16:11:55","","666-677","","5","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000621682900001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;33</p>","","","Climate change; Africa; climate change policies; complex systems; participatory modelling; poultry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Stemmed on the criticism of the current GWP metrics used with life cycle assessment (LCA), this study proposes new indicators and an interpretation grid for climate change impact in LCA, which are adaptive to present, short-term, and long-term climate goals. Methods The global mean temperature change (GMTC) is used in the indicators' definition and time parameters are introduced for a multicriteria evaluation of climate change impact. We adopt calendar-related time targets instead of a fixed time horizon. The systems are analyzed on a real-time scale and with respect to a climate-target point in time (for example, 2050 as objective for climate neutrality), in contrast with conventional LCA. The objective is to provide flexibility in system evaluation, adaptable to current and future targets. Results and discussion Four indicators are introduced: (1) the amplitude of the temperature change (GMTC(max)), representative for climate extreme events; (2) the time at which GMTC starts to definitely decrease and its distance with respect to the goal (t(last_peak)); (3) the time climate neutrality is reached and its distance with respect to the goal (t(neutral)); and (4) the accumulated warming until a targeted time, representative for sea-level rise and ice melting (integrated GMTC at a given time target, for example at the end of century iGMTC(2100)). An analysis grid is proposed based on these indicators and illustrated on 26 emission profiles involving long- and short-lived greenhouse gases with various temporalities, as well as on two dynamic LCA case studies. In the group of neutral systems, temporality is responsible for variations in GMTC(max) and iGMTC(2100). Increasing the frequency of emission/capture events flattens both indicators and provides the best performance. Equal CO2 emission systems are discriminated primarily by t(last_peak), while in the case of methane, more relief is observed for all indicators. The method allows for the design of tailored mitigation solutions in LCA application examples. Conclusions The indicators are able to discriminate and rank systems that are considered to be non-impacting, equivalently impacting, or neutral in LCA-GWP metrics. Such metrics is necessary to correctly (avoid strong simplifications) and unambiguously (with unaltered physical parameters, closer to climate physics) evaluate the effect on climate, mitigation solutions, neutrality, and support decision-making.","2021-10","2023-09-26 16:11:55","2023-09-26 16:11:55","","1913-1931","","10","26","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000710905600002","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;49</p>","","","Climate change impact; Greenhouse gas; TIME; BIOENERGY; BIOGENIC CARBON; Climate change metrics; Climate neutrality; DYNAMIC LCA; Dynamic life cycle assessment; EMISSION METRICS; Global mean temperature change; IMPACT ASSESSMENT","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is because shade trees in agroforests may buffer growing conditions by creating favorable microclimates (climate-change adaptation), and because shade trees can sequester additional carbon from the atmosphere (climate-change mitigation). However, a major challenge for agroforestry is to maximize these potential benefits while minimizing costs to production as a consequence of resource competition between shade trees and the primary crop. While the effects of shade-tree density and canopy cover on the costs and benefits of agroforests are increasingly well understood, the effects of the traits of shade trees on the effectiveness of agroforests have received less attention. Here, we assess how shade trees with different crown architecture influence production, adaptation, and mitigation goals in a major cocoa growing region in Ghana, West Africa. We quantified the effects of shade trees from nine different species across two classes of height-to-crown-base (low vs. elevated canopies) on yield, microclimate, and carbon storage. We show that shade trees with elevated crowns had large positive effects on carbon storage and neutral effects on yield, while shade trees with low crowns had smaller effects on carbon storage and simultaneously caused larger reductions in incoming light, which was associated with lower yield. Trees of both crown classes were equally effective at buffering sub-canopy temperatures and vapor pressure deficit, although trees with low crowns maintained higher relative humidity. Taken together, our results suggest that shade-tree species with elevated crowns improve the effectiveness of cocoa agroforests by providing maximum benefits for climatechange adaptation and mitigation, while minimizing short-term costs to cocoa production.","2021-12-01","2023-09-26 16:11:55","2023-09-26 16:11:55","","","","","322","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000706984200002","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;9<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;9<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;84</p>","","","CLIMATE-CHANGE; Climate-smart agriculture; OPPORTUNITIES; AGRICULTURE; Climate-change mitigation; CONSERVATION; SYSTEMS; Climate-change adaptation; COFFEE; FUNCTIONAL TRAITS; Microclimate; Shade-tree species; SUSTAINABLE INTENSIFICATION; THEOBROMA-CACAO; Traits; YIELDS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study explored climate change events, the extent of their impacts on farmers' livelihoods, farmers' adaptation strategies and the extent of the strategies on improving farmers' ability to manage the climate change impacts in the Yatta region, Kenya. The study adopted a multi-method approach that integrated qualitative and quantitative data sources. Quantitative data were obtained from 354 household interviews while qualitative data were obtained from 8 focus group discussions. The interview data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics while the discussion data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. The most experienced climate events were drought (90.7%), crop diseases (79.1%) and floods (33.30%). Livelihoods aspects greatly impacted by the climate change events were food shortage (87.29%), increased food prices (76.27%) and decreased availability of water (72.43%). Although farmers had adopted several on-farm adaptation strategies, the adoption levels remained low. Water management strategies (water conservation and water harvesting) recorded higher adoption rates of 62.71% and 53.95% respectively. The adoption of on-farm adaptation strategies had proved some potential to improve farmers' ability to deal with the experienced climate change impacts. The regression model showed that farmers were likely to adopt crop and water management practices which they perceived had a higher probability of improving their ability to cope with climate change impacts. The occurrence of climate change events in the study area has affected agriculture productivity, food security and socioeconomic status of the households. Effective integration of potential adaptation strategies into smallholder farming systems calls for measures to address adoption and implementation barriers while ensuring alignment of policies, programs and institutional support systems.

The United States and Canada are responsible for one-sixth of global greenhouse gas emissions but hold extensive natural ecosystems that store globally significant above- and below-ground carbon. Canada has initiated a process of protected area network expansion in concert with efforts at reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples, and acknowledged nature-based solutions as a key aspect of climate change mitigation. The US, although not a party to global biodiversity conventions, has recently committed to protecting 30% of its extent by 2030 and achieving the UNFCCC Paris Agreement's mitigation targets. The opportunities afforded by these dual biodiversity conservation and climate commitments require coordinated national and regional policies to ensure that new protected areas maximize biodiversity-focused adaptation and nature-based mitigation opportunities. We address how global commitments can best inform national policy initiatives which build on existing agency mandates for regional planning and species conservation. Previous analyses of global conservation priorities under climate change have been tenuously linked to policy contexts of individual nations and have lacked information on refugia due to limitations of globally available datasets. Comparison and synthesis of predictions from a range of recently developed refugia metrics allow such data to inform planning despite substantial uncertainty arising from contrasting model assumptions and inputs. A case study for endangered species planning for old-forest-associated species in the US Pacific Northwest demonstrates how regional planning can be nested hierarchically within national biodiversity-focused adaptation and nature-based mitigation strategies which integrate refugia, connectivity, and ecosystem carbon metrics to holistically evaluate the role of different land designations and where carbon mitigation and protection of biodiversity's resilience to climate change can be aligned.","2021-08","2023-09-26 16:11:55","2023-09-26 16:11:55","","3395-3414","","15","27","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000648576800001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;19<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;19<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;135</p>","","","ADAPTATION; DISTURBANCE; STRATEGIES; VULNERABILITY; climate change adaptation; CONSERVATION; climate change mitigation; VELOCITY; climate velocity; connectivity; conservation planning; NORTHERN SPOTTED OWL; PACIFIC-NORTHWEST; PRIORITY AREAS; protected areas; refugia; TARGET","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examine whether the needs of the poor influence mitigation and adaptation policies in the region. The continent is characterized by an interesting dynamic between inequality and climate change: it is predicted to disproportionately bear the effects of climate change, at the same time that it accounts for four out of the top five countries with the starkest inequality globally. In our analysis, we construct a statistical measure of social inequality for a group of 54 African countries and use the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) to obtain corresponding data on mitigation and adaptation policy actions. We then estimate the intensity of the responsiveness of the latter to the former. Using fractional regression and data imputation methods, we find a statistically significant negative relationship between social inequality and climate change policy actions in Africa. Across African countries, mitigation and adaptation actions fall by about 23% for every 1% rise in social inequality. African countries are therefore not responding to climate change threats in ways that simultaneously reduce social inequality and adapt to climate change. Furthermore, there is some evidence that countries emitting more pollutants are less likely to take action to address climate change. Our results imply that in order to address differences in the burden of climate change in Africa, a re-evaluation of current policy actions is warranted. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Producing accessible visualizations for a general audience is challenging, especially when many are based on graphics designed for scientists, present complex and abstract concepts, and utilize suboptimal design choices. This study tests whether diagnostic visualization guidelines can be used to identify communication shortcomings for climate indicators and to specify effective design modifications. Design guidelines were used to diagnose problems in three hard-to-understand indicators, and to create three improved modifications per indicator. Using online surveys, the efficacy of the modifications was tested in a control versus treatment setup that measured the degree to which respondents understood, found accessible, liked, and trusted the graphics. Furthermore, we assessed whether respondents' numeracy, climate attitudes, and political party affiliation affected the impact of design improvements. Results showed that simplifying modifications had a large positive effect on understanding, ease of understanding, and liking, but not trust. Better designs improved understanding similarly for people with different degrees of numerical capacity. Moreover, while climate skepticism was associated with less positive subjective responses and greater mistrust toward climate communication, design modification improved understanding equally for people across the climate attitude and ideological spectrum. These findings point to diagnostic design guidelines as a useful tool for creating more accessible, engaging climate graphics for the public.","2021-06","2023-09-26 16:11:55","2023-09-26 16:11:55","","","","3-4","166","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001027953800001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;32</p>","","","Climate change; Climate skepticism; Climate change acceptance; Climate communication; Indicators; Numeracy; Political ideology; Usability testing; Visualization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Climate finance has reached record levels, crossing the US$ half-trillion mark annually for the first time in 2017-18 (CPI, 2019). Action still falls far short of what is needed under a 1.5 degrees C scenario, however. Estimates include that US$ 180 billion will be needed annually for the period 2020-2030 (Global Commission on Adaptation, 2019), of which US $ 50 billion a year is necessary for Non-Annex countries1 to deliver their NDCs (UNEP, 2018). Adaptation finance is only a very small fraction (5%) of the total available climate finance, and financing for climate services and early warning systems needed to support adaptation is only a fraction of that. This paper analyses NDC adaptation priorities, the allocation of international funding, and the current status of countries' capacities to provide the climate services needed to support adaptation, using West Africa as a test case. We conclude that there is considerable potential for using such information to assess the degree to which adaptation programmes implemented with international funding are effectively addressing national adaptation priorities and improving priority adaptation outcomes, but that additional data, analysis and coordination would be needed to fully realize this potential. Finally, we identify key areas that require further investment, which, if strengthened, would leverage sustainable benefits from the funds being invested in climate change adaptation in West Africa","2021-08","2023-09-26 16:11:55","2023-09-26 16:11:55","","","","","23","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000703655600002","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;16</p>","","","Climate services; Climate change adaptation; Climate resilience; Capacity; Climate financing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Managing native vegetation in a rapidly expanding urban setting requires land management strategies that are cognizant of these impacts and how species and communities may adapt to a future climate. Here, we demonstrate how identifying climate refugia for threatened vegetation communities in an urban matrix can be used to support management decisions by local government authorities under the dual pressures of urban expansion and climate change. This research was focused on a local government area in New South Wales, Australia, that is undergoing significant residential, commercial and agricultural expansion resulting in the transition of native forest to other more intensive landuses. Our results indicate that the key drivers of change from native vegetation to urban and agriculture classes were population density and the proximity to urban areas. We found two of the most cleared vegetation community types are physically restricted to land owned or managed by council, suggesting their long-term ecological viability is uncertain under a warming climate. We propose that land use planning decisions must recognize the compounding spatial and temporal pressures of urban development, land clearing and climate change, and how current policy responses, such as biodiversity offsetting, can respond positively to habitat shifts in order to secure the longevity of important ecological communities.","2021-11-15","2023-09-26 16:11:55","2023-09-26 16:11:55","","","","","298","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000700576800004","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;61</p>","","","Climate change; BIODIVERSITY; VEGETATION; IMPACTS; PROTECTED AREAS; AUSTRALIA; Climate refugia; COVER CHANGE; Land change modeler; Land-use change; REFUGIA; Threatened plant communities","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It was was carried out basing on the Municipal Adaptive Plan for the city of Kielce and climate data from the Ministry of Investment and Development. The predicted, future parameters of the climate were estimated using the tool Weather Shift for Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP). The analysis took into consideration the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios for years 2035 and 2065, representing different greenhouse gas concentration trajectories. Scenario RCP4.5represents possible, additional radiative forcing of 4.5 W/m(2) in 2100, and RCP8.5 an additional 8.5 W/m(2). The calculated parameters included average month values of temperature and relative humidity of outdoor air, wind velocity and solar radiation. The results confirmed the increase of outdoor temperature in the following year. The values of relative humidity do not change significantly for the winter months, while in the summer months decrease is visible. No major changes were spotted in the level of solar radiation or wind speed. Based on the calculated parameters dynamic building modelling was carried out using the TRNSYS software.

We apply SD theory to climate change adaptation, focusing on a population of Colombian coffee farmers in Risaralda who are impacted by climate change. Our findings reveal a SD cycle blocking successful adaptation. Climate change impacts exacerbate farmers' pre-existing financial strain and threaten their livelihoods, yet they lack the information and political and structural support needed to take action.

We highlight these synergies across six key areas where humans need to make transformative changes in order to reduce the impacts of climate change, including energy, pol-lutants, nature, food, population and the economy.

This study provides a methodology to quantify the expected changes in future hydraulic risks at the catchment scale in the city of Pamplona. It considers climate change projections supplied by 12 climate models, 7 return periods, 2 emission scenarios (representative concentration pathway RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5), and 3 time windows (2011-2040, 2041-2070, and 2070-2100). The Real-time Interactive Basin Simulator (RIBS) distributed hydrological model is used to simulate rainfall-runoff processes at the catchment scale. The results point to a decrease in design peak discharges for return periods smaller than 10 years and an increase for the 500- and 1000-year floods for both RCPs in the three time windows. The emission scenario RCP 8.5 usually provides the greatest increases in flood quantiles. The increase of design peak discharges is almost 10-30% higher in RCP 8.5 than in RCP 4.5. Change magnitudes for the most extreme events seem to be related to the greenhouse gas emission predictions in each RCP, as the greatest expected changes are found in 2040 for the RCP 4.5 and in 2100 for the RCP 8.5.","2021-03","2023-09-26 16:11:54","2023-09-26 16:11:54","","","","6","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000651980200001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;44</p>","","","climate change; EUROPE; FREQUENCY; MODELS; CALIBRATION; EXTREME PRECIPITATION; climate models; flood change; flood risk; hydrological modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There are serious concerns that this is distracting from the need to rapidly phase out use of fossil fuels and protect existing intact ecosystems. There are also concerns that the expansion of forestry framed as a climate change mitigation solution is coming at the cost of carbon rich and biodiverse native ecosystems and local resource rights. Here, we discuss the promise and pitfalls of the NbS framing and its current political traction, and we present recommendations on how to get the message right. We urge policymakers, practitioners and researchers to consider the synergies and trade-offs associated with NbS and to follow four guiding principles to enable NbS to provide sustainable benefits to society: (1) NbS are not a substitute for the rapid phase out of fossil fuels; (2) NbS involve a wide range of ecosystems on land and in the sea, not just forests; (3) NbS are implemented with the full engagement and consent of Indigenous Peoples and local communities in a way that respects their cultural and ecological rights; and (4) NbS should be explicitly designed to provide measurable benefits for biodiversity.

While all reported that COVID-19 impacted delivery of interventions and projects to mitigate climate change, the majority stated that it would not impact their long-term climate goals, such as Net Zero by 2050. The most popular climate change mitigation interventions AOs intend to deploy between now and 2030 are on-site renewables and Electric Vehicles and related infrastructure. Engineered carbon removal interventions were considered highly unlikely to be deployed in this timeframe, with potential implications for Net Zero decarbonisation pathways. Despite the severe impacts of COVID-19 on the sector, results indicate that AOs remain committed to decarbonisation, with climate change action remaining the key priority for airports. Given ongoing financial and resource constraints, AOs will need to explore new business models and partnerships and nurture collaborative approaches with other aviation stakeholders to not only maintain progress toward Net Zero but ""build back better "".

However, most of the previous studies focus on global, national or regional dimensions, only a few have attempted to examine climate change risk at an urban scale and even less in the case of a recent literature review. As a result, a quantitative assessment of climate change risk for cities remains highly challenging. To fill this gap, the article makes a critical review of the recent literature on urban-scale climate change risk assessment, and classifies them into four major categories of studies which jointly constitute a stepwise modelling chain from global climate change towards urban-scale risk assessment. On this basis, the study summarizes the updated research progresses and discusses the major challenges to be overcome for the seamless coupling of climate simulation between different scales, the reproduction of compound climate events, the incorporation of non-market and long-lasting impacts and the representation of risk transmission insides or beyond a city. Furthermore, future directions to advance quantitative assessment of urban-scale climate change risk are highlighted, with fresh insights into improving study methodology, enriching knowledge of climate change impact on city, enhancing abundance and accessibility to data, and exploring the best practice to provide city-specific climate risk service.","2021-01","2023-09-26 16:11:54","2023-09-26 16:11:54","","","","","135","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000592384700002","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;30<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;31<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;179</p>","","","ADAPTATION; VULNERABILITY; BIAS CORRECTION; CHANGE IMPACT; AIR-POLLUTION; HEAT-RELATED MORTALITY; FLOOD RISK; Microclimate; CELLULAR-AUTOMATA; City; Climate change risk; Climate change vulnerability; LOCAL CLIMATE; Quantitative assessment; REGIONAL CLIMATE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The climate change on the other hand has a direct effect and degrades the environmental components and features of the destinations. Pakistan is highly vulnerable to changing the climate which has threatened the tourism sector. The study has emphasized on the significance of the climate in the tourism industry by using the Tourism Climate Index (TCI) which highlights suitable regions and seasons. TCI has been used worldwide to enumerate the impacts of climate change on tourism and tourist destinations. The current study calculates the TCI for four cities of Pakistan, chosen by public opinion. For measuring the index, climatic data of twenty-one years (1997-2017) were taken from the Pakistan Meteorological Department, which include temperature, precipitation, sunshine hours, humidity and wind speed. The results showed that among the seasonal distribution, autumn and spring are good seasons for tourism. Climatic suitability in summer was not favorable for Lahore and Islamabad because of high rainfall and lower thermal comfort. A rapid change in the Annual TCI score was observed and investigated through the contribution of TCI components which happens to be the core reason for the change. Analysis has shown that 75% of the study area as a Bi-modal shoulder peak and 25% as a winter peak. For city Lahore, a maximum number of months were observed as ""Excellent"" and ""Good"" for tourism due to a high TCI score. Furthermore, future projection predicts that tourism in Lahore will be highly threatened due to rapidly changing climate. Government and tourism stakeholders should conduct such relevant studies at large scale for a better understanding of favorable and unsuitable tourist destinations across Pakistan.","2021-09","2023-09-26 16:11:54","2023-09-26 16:11:54","","13607-13627","","9","23","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000611429200001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;46</p>","","","Climate change; DEMAND; IMPACTS; INDEX; Pakistan; WEATHER; Climate suitability; Tourism climate index","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Optimal governance regimes are necessary for climate change mitigation in major greenhouse gas-emitting countries and economic sectors. Given our study's domain, the 'climate change governance' concept suffices as our theoretical framework. Adopting comparative legal and policy analysis and the case study approach, we examine the climate governance regimes in four regional carbon-intensive countries - South Africa, China, Germany, and the United States of America - with the primary objective of identifying areas for improving their regulatory capacity to mitigate climate change. Thus, we examine the relationship between climate policy goals/targets, the prevailing policy environment, and supportive strategies for achieving policy goals in our case study countries. Drawing on the climate governance literature, we adopt 'target setting', 'supportive measures/strategies', 'comprehensiveness', and 'oversight body' as the indices for our analysis. Our results reveal striking similarities and contrasts in the focus countries, signalling opportunities for improvements across different parameters. The study suggests the need for policy symmetry between governance (emissions reduction) goals and regime design elements such as proportional supportive strategies and comprehensive coverage of carbon-intensive economy sectors. We also canvass the necessity of avoiding policy and institutional fragmentations that hamper the emergence of clear and well-coordinated climate policy direction in countries. As climate change governance is now at a critical juncture, this study will significantly improve the regimes of our focus countries and other jurisdictions with similar peculiarities.","2022-02","2023-09-26 16:11:53","2023-09-26 16:11:53","","43-55","","1","32","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000688426800001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;113</p>","","","TOOL; POLICY; GOVERNANCE; SUPPORT; climate change mitigation; climate change governance; policy fragmentation; policy symmetry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the complex structure of climate finance, the AF attracts attention as it differs from other funds in several aspects. As an exception from other United Nations (UNs) climate funds, AF has not been recognised as an operating entity of the Financial Mechanism of the Convention. AF is also an unprecedented example under the Convention of a fund serving in parallel two decision-making bodies (CMP and CMA) under two agreements (Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement) ratified by nonoverlapping sets of parties; with a Fund Board elected by both bodies collectively. AFs funding source is specific, it was designed to be financed from shares of the proceeds of sales of certified emission reduction units (CERs) generated by Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects but since 2012 there is a limited possibility of offsetting the emissions with CERs under the EU emissions trading system (ETS). For several years Parties were unable to agree the operating principles and procedures of a new mechanism established in article 6(4) of the Paris Agreement, which will resemble CDM, and would constitute a source of funding for the AF. Once this source of funding is available, the AF would cease to serve the Kyoto Protocol. Despite the above problems, AF was seen as a good example of how future climate funding can be designed. We examine the evolution of the above legal problems, including the most recent decisions and conclusions adopted during Conference of Parties (COP)25 in Madrid.","2021-06","2023-09-26 16:12:17","2023-09-26 16:12:17","","168-183","","2-3","23","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000672654300005","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;10</p>","","","Paris Agreement; adaptation to climate change; adaptation finance; Adaptation Fund; climate change finance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study presents an analysis of shoreline changes on 104 coral reef islands from 16 atolls in the western equatorial Pacific nation of the Federated States of Micronesia across a period coincident with rising local sea level and a high frequency of storm events. Aerial photographs from the mid-1940s and 1970s were analysed alongside recent high-resolution satellite imagery to document shoreline changes and plan form morphological adjustments in islands. Results revealed accretion has been the predominant mode of shoreline change, with 46% of the studied shorelines showing statistically significant accretion leading to a net increase of 64.37 ha (similar to 3%) of planform land area across the archipelago. Three new islands were formed with a cumulative land area of 2.05 ha, conversely, three islands were completely eroded leading to a loss of net land area of 3.20 ha, providing a record of concurrent island formation and loss within a high storm frequency setting. Reef islands in the FSM demonstrated a range of styles of planform geomorphic adjustments including island rotation, expansion, contraction, spit extension, and migration of islands on the reef platform. Results provide empirical evidence of shoreline accretion despite local sea-level rise as well as of heterogeneity in magnitude and style of geomorphic responses of reef islands across FSM with considerable variability at inter and intra-atoll scales.

The aforesaid concern was found pertinent to the main objective of this study, which is to evaluate the combined impacts of climate and socioeconomic changes on likely future water security in the Himalayan basin, India. The future climate was projected by Multi-model Ensembles under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 scenario. Land use projection under the Shared Socio-economic Pathway (SSP) 1 scenario was performed using Markov Chain, whose transition probabilities were derived using multi-layer perceptron neural networks. The results showed that future annual precipitation and temperature at the downstream part will increase from baseline by 5% - 10% and 1.0 degrees C - 1.55 degrees C, respectively. The land use projections showed that irrigated areas will decrease for Punjab by 10% - 30% and Haryana by 5% - 10% due to the increase in urbanisation, whereas it will be increased in Rajasthan by 12% - 18%. Consequently, the annual irrigation water demand was found to be decreased by 10% for Punjab and 5% for Haryana, while it will be increased by 13% for Rajasthan. Eventually, the obtained findings will be beneficial for planning strategies to ensure water security in the Himalayan region, in particular the Beas-Sutlej basin.","2021-10","2023-09-26 16:12:17","2023-09-26 16:12:17","","1-18","","2","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000710611000001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;52</p>","","","climate change; TEMPERATURE; EXTREMES; PRECIPITATION; QUANTIFICATION; BASIN; CMIP5; MODELS; land use change; global climate models; multi-model ensembles; reservoir management; SCENARIO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Deforestation precedes pasture establishment, implying tremendous amounts of greenhouse gas emissions caused by carbon stock losses. Despite several studies addressing carbon storage in forests, there is a lack of data regarding cultivated pastures. Hence, the estimation of greenhouse gas emissions associated with land-use change becomes uncertain. In this study, we assessed the carbon stock of cultivated pastures located in Rondonia, southwestern Brazilian Amazon. A total of 50 squared plots of 1 m(2) were randomly allocated in cattle ranching farms covered by Oxisols (Dystrophic Yellow and Dystrophic Red-Yellow Latosols). Carbon fraction ranged from 0.36 for belowground biomass to 0.45 gC.g(-1) d.m. for aboveground biomass. The average total carbon stock was 5.17 MgC.ha(-1), with non-significant differences when stratifying data by soil types. Considering data from the III Brazilian Inventory of Anthropogenic Emissions and Removals of Greenhouse Gases, our results suggested that land-use change from primary forests to cultivated pastures resulted in a loss of 192.54 MgC.ha(-1), which corresponds to a net emission of 705.98 MgCO(2)eq.ha(-1) to the atmosphere.

The main aim of this perspective article is to bring empirical evidence, conceptual clarity and interdisciplinary approaches to policy makers and practitioners dealing with this crucial issue. The article explores the application of a holistic, broadly termed 'systems' approach to climate services for health in the context of adaptation and resilience. It uses illustrative examples from Ethiopia, Bhutan and Germany to demonstrate and elaborate the application and merits of the systems approach to emerging climate services for health. The systems approach improves conceptual thinking about climate services for health. In addition, it is a valuable analytical framework that unifies the diverse stakeholders involved in health adaptation and resilience planning, interventions and policy making.

In the Mediterranean region, badlands are found in both dry (arid and semi-arid) and wet (subhumid and humid) environments, and are characterized by complex hydro-geomorphological dynamics, high intense erosion processes and extreme sediment yield. Understanding the impact of Global Change is key to predict the on-site and off-site effects on badland dynamics, particularly its consequences on bedrock weathering, on sediment yield and delivery and on plant colonization. Here, conducting a systematic literature review, we analyzed an extensive database and identified the main climate-drivers affecting the hydro-geomorphological dynamics in Mediterranean badlands (based on non-metric multidimensional scaling and structural equation modeling analysis). Later, we examined the main impacts expected from climate change forecasting in the near future, and we explored the interactions between badlands response to climate variation. In Mediterranean badlands, weathering processes are mainly related to wetting-drying cycles and freeze-thaw cycles in dry and wet badlands, respectively. In both environments, rainfall amount appears as the main driver for runoff response, and rainfall amount and rainfall intensity for erosion dynamics. Future climate scenarios forecast a decrease in annual rainfall, number of rainfall events and frost days, and in soil moisture, and an increase in rainfall intensity. These changes will have direct hydro-geomorphological implications with direct and indirect effects on badland dynamics. This may result in a decrease in annual runoff in dry badlands, but the occurrence of more frequent extreme events would increase soil erosion and could negatively affect biological soil crust. In wet badlands, weathering and erosion processes may decrease, and a stabilization of the slopes, with consequently improved vegetation growth, may be expected. In addition, the forecasted changes must be taken into account, especially considering the possible off-site effects of these extreme environments.","2022-01","2023-09-26 16:12:16","2023-09-26 16:12:16","","17-31","","1","47","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000633982700001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;12<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;12<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;117</p>","","","climate change; hydrology; erosion; badlands; BARDENAS REALES; DIGITAL ELEVATION MODELS; Global Change; LONG-TERM; NORTHERN NEGEV; RIVER ISABENA; RUNOFF GENERATION; SOIL-EROSION; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; SUSPENDED SEDIMENT TRANSPORT; weathering; ZIN-VALLEY-BADLANDS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A series of SPEI-based numerical experiments, using combinations of observational and nonlinear detrended climatic variable data series, was used as a synthetic approach with which to analyze the relative impact of the individual climatic variables. Results indicated that drought on the SNP has been mitigated marginally during 1961-2016, mainly during spring, winter, the growing season, and on the annual timescale. Significant trends were detected in relation to temperature, sunshine duration, and wind speed, and these variables had differing roles in drought evolution. An increasing trend in temperature was found to aggravate drought tendency at all investigated timescales; however, decreasing trends in net radiation and wind speed offset the drought tendency caused by rising temperature. The positive contribution of wind speed was larger than the negative contribution of temperature, especially in areas around 46 degrees N. Although the change of precipitation was not significant, it promoted drought mitigation on the SNP in spring, winter, the growing season, and on the annual timescale. The analysis framework used in this study was shown useful for improving understanding of the relationship between climate change and drought evolution, and it could prove helpful in providing rational and regulatory policy strategies regarding drought relief.","2021-02","2023-09-26 16:12:16","2023-09-26 16:12:16","","","","","121","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000604859400002","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;18<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;19<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;98</p>","","","TRENDS; VARIABILITY; Climate change; SOIL-MOISTURE; EVAPORATION; CHINA; Drought; POTENTIAL EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; CROP EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; Nonlinear change; Relative contribution; SONGHUA RIVER-BASIN; SONGNEN PLAIN; SPATIOTEMPORAL VARIATIONS; SPEI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous research has proven the value of low cost, scalable menu design interventions to influence food choices, without the need for large-scale educational campaigns. Here, we present two online randomized control trials to determine the effectiveness of two menu design approaches to nudge participants' food choices away from meat and towards vegetarian dishes. In study one we explore the impact of vegetarian items availability on choice. Participants were allocated to menus in which 75%, 50% or 25% of items were vegetarian. We show that meat eaters were significantly more likely to choose a vegetarian meal when presented with a menu with 75% vegetarian items, but not when half (50%) were vegetarian. This finding highlights that saturating the choice environment is required to promote vegetarian food. In study two, we explore the impact of vegetarian symbols (V) to determine if these are used by meat eaters as exclusion decision filters, as is seen in previous work with menus containing 'vegetarian' dish sections. Here we show that placement of V symbols, to either the left or right of a dish label, has no impact on choice. These studies provide insights into how the environmental footprint of the food service sector can potentially be reduced using easy and scalable menu design approaches.","2022-02","2023-09-26 16:12:16","2023-09-26 16:12:16","","","","","79","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000720810600001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;11<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;11<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;38</p>","","","Climate change; IMPACT; Sustainability; Behaviour change; Diet; Food choice","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whether depicted as success or failure, both framings can invisibilize the preexisting socioenvironmental processes that render climate-induced migrations necessary-or, conversely, that can inhibit them entirely. Perspectives on displacement and environmental migration from within political ecology and human geography offer an alternative register, looking beyond unidirectional socioeconomic or environmental drivers to document how uneven development reproduces displacements relationally and historically. Drawing on these theorizations, as well as empirical research from agrarian Southeast Asia, this article develops the notion of cumulative socionatural displacements as one approach for conceptualizing socioecologically driven displacement in a world already on the move. We demonstrate this approach through an analysis of displacement in Southeast Asia that begins by tracing the evolving state, market, and agroecological relations that have made mobility integral to agrarian viability while setting the stage for more intense climate impacts. In doing so, we also center the long-term (nonclimatic) environmental changes that are often sidelined in both anthropocentric debates on rural displacements and climate doomsday scenarios. We argue that examining climate-induced migration as just one facet of cumulative socionatural displacements is necessary for overcoming the ontological and political impasses engendered by prevailing narratives that collapse climate migration into convenient but misleading binaries.","2022-03-22","2023-09-26 16:12:16","2023-09-26 16:12:16","","664-673","","3","112","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000707102600001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;48</p>","","","ADAPTATION; climate change; ASIA; DYNAMICS; migration; MIGRATION; agrarian change; displacement; EXPANSION; INDONESIA; MEKONG DELTA; Southeast Asia; SOUTHEAST SULAWESI; TRANSFORMATION; TRANSITION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study reported here is a direct replication of Sparkman and Walton's (2017) research. We explored the effects of different kinds of normative information, particularly information about increasing (referred to as 'dynamic' or 'trending') minority norms, on interest in reducing meat consumption, attitudes toward reducing meat consumption, intentions to reduce meat consumption, and expectations to do so. Following pilot work (n = 197), we used a double-blind online study with three conditions: dynamic norm (n = 276), static norm (n = 284), and no norm (n = 286). The sample consisted of British people, with ages ranging from 18 to 79 (M-age = 37.21, SDage = 13.58; 56.38% female). There was no effect of dynamic norm information on any outcomes, including predictions about future meat consumption norms. Exploratory analyses suggest that political position and gender were associated with meat consumption outcomes. The findings are discussed in relation to conditions under which dynamic normative information may be successful in influencing motivation to engage in desired behaviours, and to possible improvements in research design.","2021-08","2023-09-26 16:12:15","2023-09-26 16:12:15","","","","15","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000682331200001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;8<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;8<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;53</p>","","","climate change; BEHAVIOR; behaviour change; environment; SOCIAL NORMS; DESCRIPTIVE NORMS; dynamic norm; norms; PROMOTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a result of globalization, which facilitates access to remote areas of the Earth, a growing number of studies is being dedicated to this endemic Arctic seabird. Research has focussed primarily on the importance of the Little Auk as an ecological indicator reacting to the climatic and oceanological changes that are particularly evident in the Arctic as a result of Arctic amplification (warming is more rapid in the Arctic than in any other region on Earth). Importantly, the species is also used as a model to investigate matter and energy flow through the ecosystem, mate choice, parental care and biological rhythms. Here, we review the natural history of the Little Auk, highlighting studies with the potential to provide answers to universal questions regarding the response of seabirds to climate variability and avian reproductive behaviour, e.g. threshold of foraging flexibility in response to environmental variability, carry-over effects between the breeding and non-breeding periods, the reasons for the transition from bi- to uni-parental care, parental coordination mechanisms.","2022-02","2023-09-26 16:12:15","2023-09-26 16:12:15","","163-176","","2","45","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000729641600001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;10<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;10<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;132</p>","","","Climate change; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BODY-MASS; BREEDING-SEASON; BROOD DESERTION; DIVING BEHAVIOR; FORAGING STRATEGY; GLAUCOUS GULL; Global changes; LEUKOCYTE PROFILE; Marine ecosystem; PARENTAL CARE; Seabird; Sentinel; SEX-DIFFERENCES","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, widespread development of irrigation may strengthen water scarcity and further increase farmers? vulnerability to water stress. In this context, understanding the conditions of the adoption of irrigation is of outmost importance to characterize the process, the risks and the policy implications of climate change adaptation. This paper presents an empirical approach for understanding the factors driving current and envisioned irrigation at farm level, by combining Internet-survey data and terroir data (precipitation, temperature, and soil water holding capacity) characterizing wine growers and farms in southeastern France (LanguedocRoussillon). Survey data include current and future practices, the perceptions of past changes, and wine growers? main objectives. The sample gathers 28% of growers that are already irrigating their vines, 39% that are considering this option for the future. Results of different econometric models show that both terroir and socioeconomic factors such as perceptions and objectives play significant roles in the adoption of irrigation. Specifically, perceptions of water scarcity seem to drive future irrigation projects much more than real water scarcity. These results carry important policy implications for water-demand forecasting and water-supply planning.","2021-05-01","2023-09-26 16:12:15","2023-09-26 16:12:15","","","","","250","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000636268000007","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;38</p>","","","TEMPERATURE; VARIABILITY; Climate change; UNCERTAINTY; Global change; Adaptation; FUTURE; ECONOMICS; WATER; AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION; FARMERS ADAPTATION; Irrigation; Perceptions; PRECIPITATION TRENDS; TECHNOLOGIES; Wine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The results showed that all generations of H. armigera at both sites showed increasing trends in population size with climate warming. Abrupt changes in phenology and population number occurred after abrupt temperature changes. Climate change had a greater effect on the phenology of H. armigera at higher latitudes than at lower latitudes and led to a greater increase in population size at lower latitudes than at higher latitudes; the temperature increase at higher latitudes will cause a greater increase in the adult moth population size in the future compared to that at lower latitudes; and abrupt changes in the phenology, temperature increase, and population size at lower latitudes occurred earlier than those at higher latitudes.

Cooling actions, especially air conditioning, receive increasing scrutiny in social science, as does engagement and communication on behaviours spanning adaptation and mitigation. In response, this paper evaluates the relation between residents' adaptation and mitigation behaviours around cooling in Fukuoka, Japan, and draws lessons for communication on encouraging adaptation and mitigation actions. A survey distributed to residents in six areas of Fukuoka, Japan, assessed perceptions of global warming and urban heat island effects, frequency of mitigation and adaptation behaviours, use of air conditioning, electricity bills and evaluation of green spaces. We observe a difference between respondents using air conditioning with an energysaving (i.e. mitigation) focus, versus those using air conditioning with an adaptation (i.e. cooling) focus. We also note residents emphasising mitigation behaviours may use shade in parks or cooling centres as alternative cooling strategies, but that awareness of effective air conditioning use may be lacking. Our findings build on existing literature by reinforcing - in a subtropical context - the need to reconsider practices around air conditioner use; and illustrate the value of a breadth of messages to promote joint mitigation and adaptation actions.","2021-02","2023-09-26 16:12:15","2023-09-26 16:12:15","","","","","65","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000615907600003","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;27<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;27<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;39</p>","","","ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; ENERGY-CONSUMPTION; Urban heat island; Climate change communication; CITIES; Urban climate change; BENEFITS; Air conditioning; AWARENESS; Cooling behaviours; GARDENS; PERCEPTION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the IAV of the nationwide annual NPP in China and the impacts of distinct climatic drivers are not well addressed. In this study, we investigated regional contributions to the IAV of the nationwide NPP and quantified the contributions of nine climatic drivers in different regions using the NPP estimated by the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford (CASA) model from 1982 to 2018. Our results showed that the simulated NPP exhibited an increasing trend of 15.2 Tg C yr(-1) at the national scale. The nationwide NPP also showed large IAV ranging from -0.29 to 0.22 Pg C with the mean absolute NPP IAV showing a descending gradient from southeastern to northwestern China. Our estimates and thirteen terrestrial biosphere models verified that humid region accounted for the largest contribution (62%) to this large IAV. Attribution analyses indicated that normal and high precipitation amount (nP, HP), as well as high temperature days (HT) and daily temperature range (DTR) exerted the largest contributions to the national NPP IAV. Regional analyses indicated that DTR and HP were the major climatic drivers to NPP IAV in humid region, whereas NPP IAV in water-limited regions (i.e., semi-humid, semi-arid, and arid regions) were tightly associated with nP, HP, and HT. DTR and nP exerted the largest contributions to NPP IAV in the Tibetan Plateau. However, more attention should be paid to the negative impacts of low temperature events and potential drought on NPP IAV in humid region and that of HT in water-limited regions. This study emphasized the dominant role of humid region in controlling the national NPP IAV and the different ecosystem responses to diverse climatic drivers, and therefore can be valuable for adaptive management of ecosystems when facing climate change.","2021-06-15","2023-09-26 16:12:15","2023-09-26 16:12:15","","","","","303","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000639140200017","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;38<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;39<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;115</p>","","","Climate change; EXTREMES; PRECIPITATION; SEQUESTRATION; TREND; CHINA; TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS; Relative contribution; Carbon cycle; CARBON-CYCLE CONCEPTS; Climate change indices; Ecosystem model; GROSS PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY; SEMIARID ECOSYSTEMS; USE EFFICIENCY; Vegetation index","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the past decade, the concept has experienced increasing popularity in policy debates and academic discussions but has seen heterogeneous applications and little practical insight. The paper aims to identify relevant perspectives on transformative approaches and transformational change in the context of climate risk management and adaptation to propose an actionable definition for practical application. Using a systematic search and review approach, we review different perspectives across policy and scientific publications, focusing on work published in the past decade and identify common features of what transformational change in the context of climate risk management and adaptation may involve. We show that different perspectives on transformational change in the context of climate risk management and adaptation persist, but certain areas of convergence are discernible. This includes understanding transformational change as part of a spectrum that begins with incremental change; involves climate risk management and adaptation measures focusing on deep-rooted, system-level change and tends to aim at enabling more just and sustainable futures; often oriented towards the long-term, in anticipation of future climate-related developments. In addition, we identify an 'operationalisation gap' in terms of translating transformational change ambitions into concrete transformative measures that can be replicated in practice.","2021-05","2023-09-26 16:12:15","2023-09-26 16:12:15","","","","5","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000644688300001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;14<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;15<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;83</p>","","","climate change; RESPONSES; KNOWLEDGE; resilience; RESILIENCE; transformation; VULNERABILITY; MITIGATION; systematic review; AGRICULTURE; CAPACITY; adaptation; climate risk; transformational change; disaster risk; DISASTER RISK; GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE; THINKING","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This region has experienced significant greening in the past three decades, but future trends remain uncertain. In this study, we provide a quantitative assessment of how vegetation, indicated by the leaf area index (LAI), will change in this region in response to future climate change. Based on the output of eleven CMIP6 global climates, Northeast China is likely to get warmer and wetter in the future, corresponding to an increase in regional LAI. Under the medium emissions scenario (SSP245), the average LAI is expected to increase by 0.27 for the mid-century (2041-2070) and 0.39 for the late century (2071-2100). Under the high emissions scenario (SSP585), the increase is 0.40 for the mid-century and 0.70 for the late century, respectively. Despite the increase in the regional mean, the LAI trend shows significant spatial heterogeneity, with likely decreases for the arid northwest and some sandy fields in this region. Therefore, climate change could pose additional challenges for long-term ecological and economic sustainability.

The second is the irrigation model (CROPWAT8.0), which is used to simulate the irrigation water requirements under current and likely climate change conditions. The results indicated that the increase in greenhouse gas emissions will cause the temperature to rise over the study area by about 2.12 degrees C in 2050 and 3.96 degrees C by 2100. As a result, wheat productivity is likely to drop by 8.6 and 11.1% in 2050 and 2100, respectively.

The results showed that (1) FVC in China increased by 14% from 2001 to 2018 with a greening rate of approximately 0.0019/year (p < 0.01), which showed an apparent greening trend. (2) On the whole, CO2, climate-related factors, and LCC accounted for 88% of FVC changes in China, and the drivers explained 82%, 89%, 90%, and 89% of the FVC changes in the Qinghai-Tibet region, northwest region, northern region, and southern region, respectively. CO2 was the major driving factor for FVC changes, accounting for 31% of FVC changes in China, indicating that CO2 was an essential factor in vegetation growth research. (3) The statistical results of pixels with land cover changes showed that LCC explained 12% of FVC changes, LCC has played a relatively important role and this phenomenon may be related to the ecological restoration projects.

Usually, however, this concept is loosely applied in the literature. In the current study, we conducted interviews with farmers in drought-prone rice-producing provinces in the Philippines to better understand the types of stressors they face in adapting to climate change. Overall, 87 farmers, 17 key informants, and 4 experts participated in the research. A range of qualitative methods were used, including interviews, focus group discussions, and windshield surveys. The findings suggest two main types of stressors: direct and distal. Direct stressors (e.g. bureaucratic hurdles and poverty) are factors that directly affect the ability to adapt to climate change. Distal stressors (e.g. infrastructure development and national development) are stressors that do not appear to be related to climate change adaptation and yet affect climate change adaptation outcomes significantly. Recognizing and taking into account these two types of stressors will help in improving the design of interventions for farmers in dealing with the impacts of climate change.","2022-07-03","2023-09-26 16:12:15","2023-09-26 16:12:15","","512-522","","6","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000673883700001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;64</p>","","","VARIABILITY; IMPACTS; RESILIENCE; PRODUCTIVITY; VULNERABILITY; FARMERS; climate change adaptation; multiple stressors; PERCEPTIONS; WATER; climate change adaptation in rice; distal stressors; LIVELIHOODS; MULTIPLE STRESSORS; Stressors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Application in Jucar River Basin District (Spain)","SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT","","0048-9697","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.148032","","Sea level rise (SLR) produced by climate change affects severely coastal ecosystems which are currently being impacted by sea level rise in many parts of the world. In relation with coastal wetlands, the most relevant induced effect will occur on water and soil s salt content, especially in areas below sea level. This could lead into a reduction of habitat for the wetlands biota. In this context, this research assesses the SLR related risk in the J & uacute;car River Basin District (JRBD). Hazard, exposure, impact, vulnerability, and risk maps have been elaborated. The design and application of measures is prioritized in those areas classified as Very High risk with the aim of improving coastal ecosystems climate change adaptation. In Western Mediterranean coast, average sea level (ASL) will rise 0.16 m (2026 & ndash;2045) and 0.79 m (2081 & ndash;2100) referred to the reference period (1986 & ndash;2005). High-end scenarios indicate that ASL will rise 1.35 m & ndash;1.92 m (2081 & ndash;2100). The risk analysis results show that 90% of JRBD area affected by SLR, corresponds to coastal wetlands. Half of the affected area belongs to LAlbufera de Valencia wetland with 32.44 km(2) below sea level, which represents a water volume of 42.64 hm(3) (2026 & ndash;2045) and a surface between 72.53 and 138.96 km(2) representing from 118.36 to 289.70 hm(3) (2081 & ndash;2100). In the case of LAlbufera de Valencia the impact will be throughout the 21st century, the average rate of SLR will leap from 4 to 11 cm per decade, therefore MSL will reach the current wetland levels by 2040 & ndash;2045. This makes necessary to modify the lakes management rules, which will lead to an increase of 40 hm(3) in water storage and a reduction in waters renewal time compared to current rates (from 15 to 5 times a year).

Recent advances suggest that the frequency and intensity of destructive flood events on the Argentinian Pampas will increase under pressure from climate change. This paper provides bottom-up insight into the flood risk for soybean production systems under climate change and the suitability of adaptation strategies in two of the most flood-prone areas of the Pampas region. The flood risk perceptions of soybean producers were explored through interviews, translated into climatic indicators and then studied using a multi-model climate data analysis. Soybean producers perceived the present flood risk for rural accessibility to be of the highest concern, especially during the harvest and sowing seasons when heavy machinery needs to reach soybean lots. An analysis of climatic change projections found a rising trend in annual and harvest precipitation and a slight drying trend during the sowing season. This indicates that the flood risk for harvest accessibility may increase under climate change. Several adaptation strategies were identified that can systemically address flood risks, but these require collaborative action and cannot be undertaken by individual producers. The results suggest that if cooperative adaptation efforts are not made in the short term, the continued increase in flood risk may force soybean producers in the case study locations to shift away from soybean towards more robust land uses.","2021-06","2023-09-26 16:12:15","2023-09-26 16:12:15","","","","6","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000665459000001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;51</p>","","","PRECIPITATION; climate change adaptation; climate change impacts; Argentina; flood risks; Pampas; production systems; soybean","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such assessments should be performed through combined approaches that integrate trait-based elements (e.g., measures of species sensitivity such as niche width) with correlative tools quantifying exposure (magnitude of changes in climate within species habitat). Furthermore, as land use alterations may increase climate impacts on biodiversity, CCVAs should focus on both climate and land use change effects. Unfortunately, most of such assessments have so far focused exclusively on exposure to climate change. Location Himalaya. Methods We evaluated the vulnerability of three otter species occurring in the Himalayan region, that is, Aonyx cinereus, Lutra lutra and Lutrogale perspicillata, to 2050 climate and land use change through the recently proposed Climate Niche Factor Analysis (CNFA) framework combined with Species Distribution Models. Results Future climate and land use change will reduce (6%-15%) and shift (10%-18%) the geographical range of the three species in the Himalaya, with land use alterations exerting far more severe effects than climate change. Among vulnerability components, sensitivity played a greater role than exposure in determining the vulnerability of the otters. Specifically, the most specialist species, L. perspicillata, showed the highest vulnerability in comparison with the most generalist, L. lutra. Main conclusions Our results underline how coupling climate and land use change components in CCVAs can generate diverging predictions of species vulnerability compared to approaches relying on climate change only. Moreover, intrinsic components, such as species sensitivity, proved significantly more important in determining vulnerability than extrinsic metrics such as habitat exposure.","2022-08","2023-09-26 16:12:14","2023-09-26 16:12:14","","1635-1649","","8","28","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000674838700001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;19<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;19<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;86</p>","","","climate change; BIODIVERSITY; land use change; CONSERVATION; WATER; DISTRIBUTIONS; COVER CHANGE; AREA; CITIZEN SCIENCE DATA; climate change vulnerability assessment; climate niche factor analysis; DISTRIBUTION MODELS; habitat exposure; LUTRA-LUTRA; NICHE FACTOR-ANALYSIS; niche width; SDMs; species distribution models","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this continental-scale study with more than 1600 forest soil samples, we verify the existence of core microbiota and lump them into a manageable number of eco-clusters based on microbial habitat preferences. By projecting the abundance differences of eco-clusters between future and current climatic conditions, we observed the potential warming-driven migration of the core microbiota under warming, partially verified by a field warming experiment at Southwest China. Specifically, the species that favor low pH are potentially expanding and moving northward to medium-latitudes (25 degrees-45 degrees N), potentially implying that warm temperate forest would be under threat of soil acidification with warming. The eco-cluster of high-pH with high-annual mean temperature (AMT) experienced significant abundance increases at middle- (35 degrees-45 degrees N) to high-latitudes (> 45 degrees N), especially under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5, likely resulting in northward expansion. Furthermore, the eco-cluster that favors low-soil organic carbon (SOC) was projected to increase under warming scenarios at low-latitudes (< 25 degrees N), potentially an indicator of SOC storage accumulation in warmer areas. Meanwhile, at high-latitudes (> 45 degrees N) the changes in relative abundance of this eco-cluster is inversely related with the temperature variation trends, suggesting microbes-mediated soil organic carbon changes are more responsive to temperature variation in colder areas. These results have vital implications for the migration direction of microbial communities and its potential ecological consequences in future warming scenarios. (C) 2021 Science China Press.

Here, we aim to decipher the influence of climate-induced changes on temporal patterns in chironomid assemblages. We apply a novel approach combining traditional taxon-based analysis and species-trait framework to subfossil chironomid assemblages in a sediment core covering the Late Glacial-Holocene transition in Northern Europe. We produce pollen-based July and January temperature reconstructions to characterize past climate fluctuations that show a distinct Early Holocene warming for continuous 1700 years with considerably greater warming in winter (ca. 10 degrees C) than summer (ca. 4 degrees C) temperature. Overall, chironomid taxonomic changes were mainly induced by the temperature tolerances and optima of species, as temporal dynamics showed agreement with temperature reconstructions. Our results suggest that vegetation dynamics could also play a role in structuring chironomid assemblages by selecting taxa with the highest ability to exploit available food resources, thus potentially confounding chironomid-based summer climate reconstructions. We demonstrate that the study of the hidden chironomid functional composition could help to identify secondary drivers and thus strengthen the reliability of climate reconstruction based on subfossil chironomids.

In this cross-sectional study, the stages of change from the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) are applied to environmentally-significant behavior. We develop and test a new scale - the Climate Change Stages of Change Questionnaire (CCSOCQ) - for measuring five discrete stages involved in changing behavior to address climate change (precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance). In total, 3,469 middle-school students (M-age = 13.4) and 347 schoolteachers completed the CCSOCQ and a measure of engagement with sustainable development. Analyses indicated the CCSOCQ captured the five stages outlined by the TTM and had adequate psychometric properties. Further supporting predictions of the TTM, engagement with sustainable development was lowest in the precontemplation stage and highest in the action stage.

Using data collected through a region-wide survey, a model to risk perceptions and professional action was constructed through structural equation modeling. The model elucidates the cascading effects of variables such as age, gender, education, and personal values on action. In particular, it highlights a split in motivating factors among individuals with higher levels of self-enhancing values versus those with higher levels of self-transcending values. The model also highlights the prominent role that experience of extreme weather events, psychological proximity of climate change, climate change risk perceptions, and social norms play in motivating action. The model, therefore, offers a framework for prioritizing the various factors that motivate people to take adaptation action, which, in turn, provides a basis for informing climate services development going forward.","2021-10","2023-09-26 16:12:14","2023-09-26 16:12:14","","1873-1889","","10","41","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000609001000001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;87</p>","","","climate change; DETERMINANTS; IMPACTS; VULNERABILITY; ENGAGEMENT; CHANGE ADAPTATION; VALUES; Africa; PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTANCE; SKEPTICISM; PUBLIC PERCEPTIONS; EXPERIENCE; Action; climate services; risk perceptions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The research used five different extreme precipitation indices, i.e., annual precipitation total (PRCPTOT), the annual number of rainy days (RD), simple daily intensity index (SDII), consecutive dry days (CDDs), and consecutive wet days (CWD). The PRCTOT was generally located in eastern Thailand, with significant declining trends, while the increasing trend was found in northern Thailand. The quantity of the PRCPTOT varies marginally from 100 to 200 mm per decade. The annual RD was influenced mostly by the negative trends in Thailand. A remarkable trend is a rising of annual SDII, with major statistical increases ranging from 5 to 20%. A widespread decline in CWD was found in most regions. The statistically significant pattern of CWD has been geographically concentrated in the northern, southern, and eastern regions of Thailand. Southern Thailand continues to decline by -10 to -30%. A drastic decline has been observed in the south of Thailand.

For accuracy validation, high spatial resolution satellite imagery (Google Earth similar to 1.0 m and Planet's high-resolution, analysis-ready mosaics of the world's tropics similar to 4.7 m) and field control points were used as reference data. Overall accuracy values (all coverages) ranged from 86-99%, with accuracy for glacier area coverage between 97-100%. The decrease in the glacier area is of 1099.59 ha over 34 years (1987-2021). This analysis revealed that the glacier area decreased by approximately 37.92% regarding the first scene (1987). According to this trend, the SRC glacier would be extinct by 2048. The rate of glacier retreat is mainly influenced by factors related to global warming, such as the increase in mean annual temperature and the decrease in precipitation rates and climate variability factors such as the El Nino phenomenon.","2022-01","2023-09-26 16:12:14","2023-09-26 16:12:14","","49-73","","1","44","","","","","","","","","","Spanish","","","","WOS:000753738800003","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;75</p>","","","Climate change; CLIMATE; BASIN; ACCURACY; Climate variability; TIME; AREA; Accuracy; AMERICA; Andes; CORDILLERA; ICE-AGE; SNOW-COVER; Supervised classification; TROPICAL ANDES","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A typology can inform stakeholders about the physical hazards a coastal town or small city may be exposed currently and in the future; identify the impact that may have to the local population and the economic, cultural, and environmental assets in the settlement; and identify any barriers or opportunities to plan, develop, and implement adaptation strategies. A typology is presented here that includes 34 parameters that cover physical, economic, environmental and social characteristics. This typology has been used within this Special Issue to obtain information about all 22 case studies of the Special Issue. Future work will concentrate on developing the typology further and analysing the data collected to provide a systematic understanding of some of the data gaps that still exist within the field of adaptation in coastal towns and small cities and allow future research to focus on the aspects that are most needed.","2021-10-15","2023-09-26 16:12:14","2023-09-26 16:12:14","","","","","212","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000703607300014","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;19</p>","","","Climate change; VULNERABILITY; Climate adaptation; Coastal hazards; Data collection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the dominant incremental policy approaches have not generated action at anywhere near the rate, scale or depth that is needed. This is largely due to the fact that climate change has historically been framed as a purely external, technical challenge. There is an urgent need for a more integral understanding that links internal and external (collective and systems) approaches to support transformation. However, related knowledge is scarce and fragmented across disciplines. This study addresses this gap. Through a systematic literature review, we analyse how the linkages between internal and external change are portrayed and understood in current research. We assess the scope, perspectives and approaches used to understand why, and how, internal change relates to climate action and sustainability. Our results highlight patterns and gaps regarding foci, conceptualisation, methods, epistemology, ontology and ethics that hamper emergent solutions and progress.

In particular, almost all CMIP5 models feature a substantial strengthening of the westerlies to the south of Australia and enhancement of the subtropical jet over the eastern Pacific in winter. In this study we investigate the mechanisms behind these changes, finding that the stationary wave response can largely be explained via reductions in the magnitude of the upper-level Rossby wave source over the tropical/subtropical east Pacific. The Rossby wave source changes in this region are robust across the model ensemble and are strongly correlated with changes to low-latitude circulation patterns, in particular, the projected southward migration of the Hadley cell and weakening of the Walker circulation. To confirm our mechanism of future changes, we employ a series of barotropic model experiments in which the barotropic model is given a background state identical to a particular CMIP5 model and an anomalous Rossby wave source is imposed. This simple approach is able to capture the primary features of the ensemble-mean change, including the cyclonic anomaly south of Australia, and is also able to capture many of the intermodel differences. These findings will help to advance our understanding of the mechanisms underpinning SH extratropical circulation changes under climate change.","2021-10","2023-09-26 16:12:13","2023-09-26 16:12:13","","7897-7912","","19","34","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000752634100008","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;59</p>","","","Climate change; UNCERTAINTY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CMIP5; Climate models; EL-NINO; SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; WINTER; ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION; HADLEY-CELL; JET; PROPAGATION; Southern Hemisphere; Stationary waves","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Over the past two decades, an increasing number of OHC studies were conducted using oceanic objective analysis (OA) products. Here we perform an intercomparison of OHC from eight OA products with a focus on their robust features and significant differences over the Argo period (2005-19), when the most reliable global-scale oceanic measurements are available. For the global ocean, robust warming in the upper 2000 m is confirmed. The 0-300-m layer shows the highest warming rate but is heavily modulated by interannual variability, particularly El Nifio-Southern Oscillation. The 300-700- and 700-2000-m layers, on the other hand, show unabated warming. Regionally, the Southern Ocean and midlatitude North Atlantic show a substantial OHC increase, and the subpolar North Atlantic displays an OHC decrease. A few apparent differences in OHC among the examined OA products were identified. In particular, temporal means of a few OA products that incorporated other ocean measurements besides Argo show a global-scale cooling difference, which is likely related to the baseline climatology fields used to generate those products. Large differences also appear in the interannual variability in the Southern Ocean and in the long-term trends in the subpolar North Atlantic. These differences remind us of the possibility of product-dependent conclusions on OHC variations. Caution is therefore warranted when using merely one OA product to conduct OHC studies, particularly in regions and on time scales that display significant differences.","2021-10","2023-09-26 16:12:13","2023-09-26 16:12:13","","7875-7895","","19","34","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000752634100007","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;7<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;7<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;54</p>","","","Climate change; Climate variability; TEMPERATURE TRENDS; ATLANTIC; Databases; Ocean; Oceanic variability; SALINITY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study assesses the vulnerability of fishery-based livelihoods to the impacts of climate variability and change across two major islands in Seychelles based on 80 household surveys and three shared dialogue workshops (SDWs) with small-scale fishers. Results showed that the percentage of fishers' households that depend mainly on fisheries as a source of income was 95% and 97% for Mahe and Praslin respectively with alternative income streams along the fishing value chain such as transportation, fish mongers and processor. Fishers on Mahe Island had a dependency ratio index that was slightly higher than those on Praslin. Overall, fishing households on Mahe showed greater vulnerability on socio-demographic profile index compared to their counterparts on Praslin. However, greater livelihood diversification was recorded for householders on Mahe than Praslin as fishers earned income from tourism-related activities such as guest house, car rental, boat ride, and sales of coconuts as mentioned during the SDWs. Fishers on Mahe struggled to find fish for 3 months during the southeast monsoon season compared to 2 months for those on Praslin given that access is granted to fish in the lagoon during this season. More importantly, the voluntary closure of some fishing zones between the months of November to April on Praslin is a sustainability strategy that witnessed an increase in size and number for both rabbit and parrotfish. Further studies are needed in two key areas as follows: the role of subsidies and sustainable fisheries management, and a value-chain approach to vulnerability of small-scale fishers within the fishery sector in Seychelles.","2021-11-08","2023-09-26 16:12:13","2023-09-26 16:12:13","","","","1","2","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000953283900001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;95</p>","","","Climate change; IMPACTS; Fisheries; Climate variability; WATER; Index; Livelihoods; Seychelles","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Shortwave radiation plays a key role in Arctic warming during summer months, and absorbed shortwave radiation has been increasing largely because of greater sea ice loss. Clouds can influence this ice-albedo feedback by modulating the amount of shortwave radiation incident on the Arctic Ocean. In turn, clouds impact the amount of time that must elapse before forced trends in Arctic shortwave absorption emerge from internal variability. This study determines whether the forced climate response of absorbed shortwave radiation in the Arctic has emerged in the modern satellite record and global climate models. From 18 years of satellite observations from CERES-EBAF, we find that recent declines in sea ice are large enough to produce a statistically significant trend (1.7 x 10(6) PJ or 3.9% per decade) in observed clear-sky absorbed shortwave radiation. However, clouds preclude any forced trends in all-sky absorption from emerging within the existing satellite record. Across 18 models from phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), the predicted time to emergence of absorbed shortwave radiation trends varies from 8 to 39 and from 8 to 35 years for all-sky and clear-sky conditions, respectively, across two future scenarios. Furthermore, most models fail to reproduce the observed cloud delaying effect because of differences in internal variability. Contrary to observations, one-third of models suggest that clouds may reduce the time to emergence of absorbed shortwave trends relative to clear skies, an artifact that may be the result of inaccurate representations of cloud feedbacks.","2021-02","2023-09-26 16:12:13","2023-09-26 16:12:13","","931-948","","3","34","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000615485100006","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;56</p>","","","VARIABILITY; Climate change; SYSTEM; IMPACTS; COVER; CLOUDS; TREND; SEA-ICE; SURFACE; Climate variability; Arctic; Clouds; PLANETARY ALBEDO; Shortwave radiation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Moisture Index (MI) is a climate-based indicator currently used in the National Building Code of Canada (NBCC) to guide the design of wall assemblies for acceptable durability performance. In this study, future changes in MI are calculated across Canada under 2 and 3.5 degrees C of future global warming. Results indicate that the coastal and great lakes regions of Canada will have increased MI, whereas prairies and northern regions will in the future have decreased values of MI. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that drastically different projected future MI changes can be obtained with different values of drying potential normalization factor, and it is suggested that this value is chosen by carefully analyzing the historical and future projected drying potential values. Finally, our analysis shows that wall assemblies at an increased number of reference locations given in the NBCC, importantly those falling in the densely populated south-western Ontario region, will need to be designed with additional safety measures such as a capillary break in the future for them to achieve satisfactory moisture performance over their design lives.","2021-07-15","2023-09-26 16:12:13","2023-09-26 16:12:13","","","","","199","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000663460400004","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;48</p>","","","Climate change; IMPACT; Building design; Climate model; Moisture index","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Observed spatial scales are quantified from gridded observed daily rainfall data, in terms of the size (area) of daily contiguous wet grid-points (referred to as 'wet patches'), as well as from the spatial autocorrelations of 7-91-day running averages of rainfall. Model S2S reforecast skill is measured using the anomaly correlation coefficient between observed and simulated weekly and monthly rainfall from an 11-member ensemble of European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reforecasts (1998-2017). Both measures of S2S predictability are found to be systematically lower over land than sea, usually peaking at the start or end of the rainy season and decreasing during the core. Small spatial scales and low skill over equatorial/northern tropical Africa and western Amazonia coincide with small daily rainfall patch size and strong synoptic-scale (<= 7 days) variability there. Over most of South and SE Asia, daily wet patches are larger and strongly modulated by intraseasonal oscillations, boosting S2S rainfall predictability, while this is offset by large daily mean rainfall intensities that increase the noise. In consequence, S2S rainfall skill here generally remains low. Several land areas (as around Maritime Continent from the Philippines to Northern Australia, Eastern and Southern Africa, Eastern South America) exhibit larger spatial scales and skill, especially where the relative amplitude of SST-forced interannual variations is strong. Most of the Maritime Continent illustrates such behaviour, but even here, the time-averaged spatial scales and skill drop during the core of the rainy season.","2021-10","2023-09-26 16:12:13","2023-09-26 16:12:13","","5596-5624","","12","41","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000650546200001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;102</p>","","","climate change; VARIABILITY; PRECIPITATION; climate variability; CONVECTION; ENSEMBLE; CLIMATE PREDICTABILITY; COHERENCE; EAST-AFRICAN RAINFALL; MADDEN-JULIAN-OSCILLATION; MONSOON ONSET; statistical climatology; synoptic climatology; TEMPERATE TROUGHS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, this approach is only adequate for determining current and future water supply risks if nonstationarity in past and future climate is accounted for. In this study, we develop an approach for stochastically generating future seasonal (monthly to annual) hydroclimatic conditions at multiple sites for water supply security assessment that capitalizes on an Australia-wide relationship between annual average daily maximum temperature and annual rain (and flow). This approach is practical as it (i) avoids the extra time and additional uncertainties introduced by downscaling and bias correction of climate model produced rainfall information and (ii) takes advantage of the fact that climate model projections for temperature change are more realistic than climate model projections for rainfall. The approach is applied to a case study for catchments supplying Sydney, Australia's largest city. Two future scenarios were evaluated, 1 and 2 degrees C warming over the next 50 years. Large reductions in streamflow were simulated, particularly for the 2 degrees C scenario, resulting in major impacts on water security in the absence of any intervention. This is consistent with recent warming since 1990 being associated with more than a 40% decrease in average annual streamflow when compared with the average annual streamflow over the similar to 110 years historical record.","2021-02","2023-09-26 16:12:13","2023-09-26 16:12:13","","","","2","57","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000624603200033","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;12<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;12<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;68</p>","","","climate change; VARIABILITY; MODEL; PRECIPITATION; UNCERTAINTY; RUNOFF; SIMULATION; WATER-RESOURCES; climate variability; VULNERABILITY; drought; DROUGHT RISK; STATIONARITY; stochastic; water security","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To guide future expectations about droughts, this study aims to assess large-scale variability of hydrological stores (groundwater, soil moisture, and surface water) and their responses to drought intensities over large semi-arid domains in Australia. Multi-scaled indicators synthesised from in-situ rainfall (SPI-standardised precipitation index), water budget (SPEI-standardised evapotranspiration precipitation index), model (soil moisture-SM), and satellite observations (groundwater storage-GWS, surface water extent-SWE, and terrestrial water storage-TWS) are employed to assess this variability in climatic hotspots identified through statistical rotation. The link between these hotspots and climate modes are diagnosed using gaussian kernel-based SVMR (support vector machine regression), and quantile function of storage (QFS) is used to assess the response of hydrological stores to climate variability. The capability of these indicators to capture impacts of water deficit on agricultural systems is explored by implementing a PLSR (partial least square regression). Results show that (i) drought characteristics and intensities vary greatly across Australia but hotspots of higher drought duration and intensity are predominant in regions below latitude 25 degrees S, (ii) hydrological drought indicators (SPEI/SPI-12) are better predictors of hydrological stores such as TWS and GWS, though the latter shows strong but opposite phase relationship with climate data, (iii) influence of climate teleconnections is better diagnosed and predicted with SPEI/SPI-12, and the Murray Darling basin-MDB (r = 0.84, alpha = 0.05) and central/east coast (r = 0.80, 0.79, alpha = 0.05) are major teleconnection hotspots, (iv) SM and GWS losses in the MDB occurred 60% and about 44% of the time, respectively, during the 2002 2017 period, (v) extreme events (droughts and floods) affect the distribution of SWE, and (vi) meteorological drought indicators (SPEI/SPI-3) are excellent metrics that capture variability in crop production.

This dawning realisation has led to calls to 'leave fossil fuels in the ground'. While a growing body of scholarship on 'supply-side climate policies' shows how policies curbing fossil fuel production can contribute to climate objective, there has been scarce attention to the role of law in regulating fossil fuel production. With a view to filling this gap, this article investigates the changing role of international law in addressing fossil fuel production to achieve climate change goals. The limitations of the siloed thinking in international law are illustrated with reference to international climate change law, human rights law, and investment law. The normative guidance emerging from these bodies of law for governments and fossil fuel companies regarding the transition away from fossil fuel production is unclear, and at times conflicting. The article thus calls for a rethinking of international law in supporting the shift away from fossil fuel production to achieve climate goals.","2021-09","2023-09-26 16:12:12","2023-09-26 16:12:12","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000716432600028","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;28<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;29<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;117</p>","","","Climate change; PARIS AGREEMENT; POLICIES; Fossil fuels; Climate policy; CARBON; COAL; International law","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The vast population of the urban areas exerts significant effects on climate change even though they cover a small proportion of the surface of the Earth; however, impacts of urbanization on climate and ecosystems remain inadequately understood. In the meantime, urbanization continues to increase and in 2030, two-thirds of the population is expected to be living in urban areas with an increasing rate in time. It is of great importance to elaborate on the relations between urbanization and climate. In this respect, the use of information technologies with an extensive computational capacity is one of the cornerstones of climate and urban studies. Machine learning is a branch of computer science that deals with the automated recognition of patterns from data. The use of machine learning algorithms can bring significant advantages to both understandings and predicting the climate. The computational power with big data, their ability to capture nonlinear behavior, and learn as new data arrive make machine learning a useful tool for understanding climate and developing urban planning.

The CMIP5 simulations include runs with (i) no external forcing (Control runs), (ii) natural external forcing only (Natural-Forcing), or (iii) natural plus anthropogenic forcings combined (All-Forcings). We assess whether the CMIP5 All-Forcing ensemble is consistent with observations and whether there is model-based evidence for detectable anthropogenic influence for the observed SLP trends. For the 1901-2010 and 1951-2010 trends, a robustly detectable anthropogenic signal in both observational data products is a zonal band of SLP increase extending over much of the Southern Hemisphere extratropics (30 degrees-50 degrees S). In contrast, the HadSLP2_lowvar and 20CRv3 observed data products disagree on the sign of the century-scale trends in SLP over much of the low-latitude region 25 degrees N-25 degrees S. These differences will limit confident detection/attribution/consistency conclusions for lower-latitude regions, at least until the observational data product discrepancies are better reconciled. The Northern Hemisphere extratropics remains a difficult region for identifying any detectable anthropogenic influence for annual- or seasonal-mean SLP trends. Overall, our results highlight the difficulty in detecting and attributing anthropogenic signals in SLP for relatively short time scales. The observed 1981-2010 regional trends typically have a different pattern and magnitude from the simulated externally forced trends. Consequently, our results suggest that internal variability is likely the dominant driver of most observed 1981-2010 regional trend features, including the pronounced increase in SLP over the central and eastern equatorial Pacific.","2021-01","2023-09-26 16:12:12","2023-09-26 16:12:12","","327-346","","1","34","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000615484800020","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;35</p>","","","Climate change; Climate models; Interdecadal variability; Pressure; Trends","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Environmental justice research, which is essentially based on theories of social and spatial justice and provides a normative framework for thinking, focuses on the unequal distribution of environmental harms and risks and their social consequences. Environmental justice research aims to explore the economic, social, health, and legal differences that individuals and groups face in their environment as a result of environmental processes, decision making, power relations, and law enforcement practices. This is largely related to the subjective perception of individuals and the perception of injustices by different actors. In the vast majority of environmental justice studies, spatiality provides a framework for interpreting and understanding environmentally unjust situations and processes. Environmental justice is therefore riot only a natural, but also a socially dependent phenomenon, in which the key element is nevertheless the non-human factor (e.g. environmental events such as floods), which affects individuals and groups in different ways. As a result, an environmentally unjust state and situation may occur. The evolved injustices also interact with inherited spatial inequalities, existing socioeconomic systems, and the institutional structures that originally shape them. This paper summarizes the theoretical framework of environmental justice in geography and spatial sciences. The study adapts the theory ofjustice to post -socialist and Hungarian specificities and forms of environmental injustice, and examines decision -making processes and the perception of risks. In Hungary social problems and differences have been increasing in recent decades, and marginalisation and polarisation processes have added new spatial patterns to existing inequalities, directly and indirectly affecting environmental processes as well. Attempts at eliminating environmental injustices have resulted in new injustices, or deepened existing ones, due to the lack of a complex socio-environmental spatial approach of interventions. The solution to these injustices presupposes the effective and meaningful involvement of the affected people in policy -making and implementation processes, regardless of gender, age, origin, identity, or income. Otherwise, the unjust situation will persist and crisis areas affected by environmental injustices may develop.","2021","2023-09-26 16:12:12","2023-09-26 16:12:12","","76-103","","4","35","","","","","","","","","","Hungarian","","","","WOS:000729219100005","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;87</p>","","","climate change; climate justice; SUSTAINABILITY; SYSTEMS; EQUITY; FLOODS; inequality; LAND USES; marginalization; QUALITY; RACE; RISK SOCIETY; theory ofjustice","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our analysis of empirical documentation of migration factors as well as theoretical demographic models shows three predominate types of US cities affected by climate migration pathways: (1) vulnerable cities-those that will suffer significant losses in population and tax revenue; (2) recipient cities-those that serve as unsuspecting or unwilling ""receiving communities"" from sudden-onset disasters without preparation; and (3) climate destinations-cities seeking to rebrand their communities as ""climate havens"" that welcome displaced residents through equitable planning and preparation. Despite the evidence of such migration trends, there currently is limited guidance for governments at any scale to plan and prepare for these changes. Forced or unplanned migrations will have a profound and disproportionate impact on communities of color, the elderly, and other at-risk populations that are already experiencing the compounding effects of climate and environmental injustices. A lack of adequate preparation and resources dedicated to minimizing the impacts of planned and unplanned migration pathways could exacerbate existing economic, environmental, and social inequalities. Drawing from case studies in cities across the country that illustrate the typology outlined above, this paper presents a framework with preliminary strategies for policy makers to bridge knowledge gaps and design responses for both short- and long-term planning initiatives. In particular, we encourage the use of typological frameworks for implementing scenario planning that can help cities navigate the challenges of planning for future climate-migration to plan for more sustainable, inclusive, and equitable cities for all.","2021-09","2023-09-26 16:12:12","2023-09-26 16:12:12","","465-480","","3","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000681161400001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;10<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;10<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;129</p>","","","ADAPTATION; Climate change; SEA-LEVEL RISE; POLICY; DISASTERS; Climate migration; JUSTICE; Equity; HURRICANE KATRINA; Justice; LOUISIANA; Managed retreat; MANAGED RETREAT","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To improve the understanding of how climate vulnerability is expressed in agricultural environments, it is necessary to address how people perceive and interact with their surroundings. This study analyzes farmers' perceptions of a set of climate change indicators and their influence on agricultural practices in two Indigenous communities located at different altitudes in Mexico. Farmers' observations were explored using semi-structured interviews and contextualized within the local instrumental climate record. The influence of these farmers' perceptions on their agricultural practices was further analyzed using a logistic regression model. Changes in rain intensity and seasonality, as well as in wind intensity, were mentioned most frequently. Farmers' experiences suggest a reduction in rain and wind intensity and shorter rainy seasons. Memories of past anomalous years coincide with precipitation anomalies found in the instrumental records. However, temperature changes and biotic indicators were seldom perceived. Our results show that the perception of these indicators is mediated by agricultural practices, and we found evidence indicating that these perceptions during the first stage of the seasonal calendar induce readjustments in sowing dates. Moreover, farmers resort to out-migration, integration of cash crops, and use of commercial fertilizers to cope with or reduce crop loss due to climate impacts.","2021-10","2023-09-26 16:12:12","2023-09-26 16:12:12","","349-367","","3","41","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000706460400004","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;58</p>","","","IMPACTS; KNOWLEDGE; RESILIENCE; MANAGEMENT; VULNERABILITY; climate change adaptation; FARMERS PERCEPTIONS; ADAPTATION STRATEGIES; AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS; CENTRAL MEXICO; climate perception; crop management; MAIZE; milpa","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Twenty-two extreme climate indices from ETCCDI were computed for 1950-1989 and 1990-2020 periods. Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope test were performed to estimate the trends from the indices from both station and RCMs data. Highly significant increasing trend for the warm days and warm nights' frequencies were found, whereas, the frequency of cold days and cold nights indicated significantly decreasing trend. On the other hand, mild increasing trend in 1-day and 5-day maximum rainfall was detected. Also, the average annual precipitation has increased by 6% from the 1950-1989 to 1990-2020 period. During the last three decades, the region has experienced more heavier rainfall in the monsoon but increased water stress in the dry season.

The availability of spatially interpolated climate data has the potential to make viticultural climate analyses possible at specific sites without the expense and uncertainty of collecting climate data within vineyards. The aim of this study was to compare the accuracy and precision of climatic indices calculated using an on-site climate sensor and an interpolated climate dataset to assess whether the effect of spatial variability in climate at this fine spatial scale significantly affects phonological modelling outcomes. Methods and Results: Four sites comprising two topographically homogenous vineyards and two topographically diverse vineyards in three wine regions in Victoria (Australia) were studied across four growing seasons. A freely available database of interpolated Australian climate data based on government climate station records (Scientific Information for Land Owners, SILO) provided temperature data for grid cells containing the sites (resolution 0.05 degrees latitude by 0.05 degrees longitude, approximately 5 km x 5 km). In-vineyard data loggers collected temperature data for the same time period. The results indicated that the only significant difference between the two climate data sources was the minimum temperatures in the topographically varied vineyards where night-time thermal layering is likely to occur. Conclusion: The interpolated climate data closely matched the in-vineyard recorded maximum temperatures in all cases and minimum temperatures for the topographically homogeneous vineyards. However, minimum temperatures were not as accurately predicted by the interpolated data for the topographically complex sites. Therefore, this specific interpolated dataset was a reasonable substitute for in-vineyard collected data only for vineyard sites that are unlikely to experience night-time thermal layering. Significance of the Study: Access to accurate climate data from a free interpolation service, such as SILO provides a valuable tool tomanage blocks or sections within vineyards more precisely for vineyards that do not have a weather station on site. Care, nevertheless, is required to account for minimum temperature discrepancies in topographically varied vineyards, due to the potential for cool air pooling at night, that may not be reflected in interpolated climate data.","2021-07-13","2023-09-26 16:12:12","2023-09-26 16:12:12","","","","","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000678634100001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;66</p>","","","climate change; TEMPERATURE; IMPACT; phenology; DYNAMICS; WINE; YIELD; GROWING REGIONS; VITICULTURE; climate data; climatic indices; GRAPEVINE PHENOLOGY; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; SHIRAZ; viticulture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We have used the Generalized Linear Model with Quasi-Poisson link function to model the number of deaths in the country and to assess the impact of maximum temperature on mortality. We have found that the maximum temperature in the country has a significant impact on mortality. The number of deaths in Pakistan increases as the maximum temperature increases. We found that, as the maximum temperature increase beyond 30 degrees C, mortality increases significantly. Our results indicate that mortality increases by 27% when the maximum temperature in the country increases from medium category to a very high level. Similarly, the number of deaths in the country increases by 11% when the temperature increases from medium temperature to high level. Furthermore, our study found that when the maximum temperature in the country decreases from a medium level to a low level, the number of deaths in the country decreases by 23%.

However, only few studies have investigated the changes in turbine hub-height wind characteristics over the region under changing climate. This study aims at assessing the impact of climate change on wind power density (WPD) over West Africa using the simulations from the newly developed Coupled Model Intercomparison Project version 6 (CMIP6) models. The CMIP6 near-surface wind speed and directions simulations for the historical climate (1985-2014) were compared with ERA5 reanalysis data using multiple descriptive statistics. Relative to ERA5 reanalysis, the CMIP6 models alongside their multimodel ensemble mean (EnsMean) realistically reproduce the near-surface wind characteristics (i.e. wind speed and directions) across most subregions of West Africa, although noticeable biases still exist. Overall, the CMIP6 EnsMean performs better than most individual models at capturing the near-surface wind speed over the region. Under global warming, we find a robust projected increase (about 70%) in WPD over the Guinea coast subregion of West Africa, especially in June-July-August season. The December-January-February and March-April-May seasons show alternating projected WPD increase and decrease, with predominantly robust projected decrease over the Sahel subregion. The projected increase over the Guinea coast has strong temporal qualities, with the end of the century (2070-2099) changes showing stronger magnitude compared to the mid-century (2040-2069) changes, and thus may provide a commercially viable renewable energy source.","2021-04","2023-09-26 16:12:11","2023-09-26 16:12:11","","","","4","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000632864200001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;26<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;26<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;71</p>","","","climate change; CMIP6; climate model; CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS; Africa; renewable energy; POWER RESOURCES; RESOURCE ASSESSMENT","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Countries' effectiveness in fostering climate resilience will depend on the pace of both developments under different socio-economic and emission pathways. Here we assess trajectories of adaptation readiness in comparison with the continued emergence of hot days as a proxy for climate change hazards for different emission and socio-economic pathways over the 21st century. Putting the future evolution of both indices in relation to the observed dynamics over the recent past allows us to provide an assessment of the prospects of future climate resilience building beyond what has been experienced to date. We show that only an inclusive and sustainable stringent mitigation pathway allows for effective climate resilient development over the 21st century. Less inclusive or fossil-fuel driven development will not allow for improvements in resilience building beyond the recent past. Substantial differences emerge already in the 2020s.

This research theme has gained prominence due to the realisation that climatic changes will likely compromise human welfare and community stability, with significant implications for governments' security agendas. The Indo-Pacific region is an important case study for understanding climate security given its ongoing environmental and developmental challenges and the cultural, political and economic tensions existing within and between neighbouring countries. This paper presents a systematic review and synthesis of academic and ""grey"" literatures that address climate adaptation, disaster management or regional security in the Indo-Pacific. From this review, we identify four key themes that arise prominently in discussion and analysis prepared by academic scholars, governments and non-government organisations alike. The ubiquity of these themes speaks to the interdependent nature of the adaptation, disaster management and security challenges. The literature is in agreement that maintaining and enhancing climate security in the Indo-Pacific will depend on the region's capacity to strategically coordinate between the activities of governments, industry and communities; the willingness of governments to meaningfully cooperate with communities and each other despite existing tensions; governments' ability to manage limited resources efficiently; and their capacity to identify and address climate-maladaptive path dependencies. We highlight the most popular prescriptions for addressing these concurrent challenges at the current time. We argue that these prescriptions warrant further research and will likely have broader applicability for addressing climate security challenges in other regions of the world.","2021-08","2023-09-26 16:12:11","2023-09-26 16:12:11","","","","3-4","167","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000686707600001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;164</p>","","","Climate change; FOOD SECURITY; ASIA; MANAGEMENT; VULNERABILITY; OPPORTUNITIES; POLICY; CHANGE ADAPTATION; Resilience; Climate security; COASTAL; COMMUNITY; DISASTER RISK REDUCTION; Governance; Indo-Pacific","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we apply the storyline approach to 21st century projections of summer air stagnation over Europe and the United States. We use a Climate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) ensemble to generate stagnation storylines based on the forced response of three remote drivers of the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitude atmospheric circulation: North Atlantic warming, North Pacific warming, and tropical versus Arctic warming. Under a high radiative forcing scenario (SSP5-8.5), models consistently project increases in stagnation over Europe and the U.S., but the magnitude and spatial distribution of changes vary substantially across CMIP6 ensemble members, suggesting that future projections are not well-constrained when using the ensemble mean alone. We find that the diversity of projected stagnation changes depends on the forced response of remote drivers in individual models. This is especially true in Europe, where differences of similar to 2 summer stagnant days per degree of global warming are found amongst the different storyline combinations. For example, the greatest projected increase in stagnation for most European regions leads to the smallest increase in stagnation for southwestern Europe; i.e. limited North Atlantic warming combined with near-equitable tropical and Arctic warming. In the U.S., only the atmosphere over the northern Rocky Mountain states demonstrates comparable stagnation projection uncertainty, due to opposite influences of remote drivers on the meteorological conditions that lead to stagnation.","2022-01","2023-09-26 16:12:11","2023-09-26 16:12:11","","","","1","17","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000736309200001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;57</p>","","","TEMPERATURE; VARIABILITY; CMIP6; CLIMATE-CHANGE; IMPACT; climate models; CHINA; SENSITIVITY; POLLUTION; ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION; extratropics; meteorology; PACIFIC; PARTICULATE MATTER; regional climate change","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The future changes are computed for two time slices (2040-2059 and 2080-2099) relative to the reference period (1995-2014) under four Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs, SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5). The CMIP6 GCMs successfully capture the main climate characteristics across South America. However, they exhibit varying skill in the spatiotemporal distribution of precipitation and temperature at the sub-regional scale, particularly over high latitudes and altitudes. Future precipitation exhibits a decrease over the east of the northern Andes in tropical South America and the southern Andes in Chile and Amazonia, and an increase over southeastern South America and the northern Andes-a result generally consistent with earlier CMIP (3 and 5) projections. However, most of these changes remain within the range of variability of the reference period. In contrast, temperature increases are robust in terms of magnitude even under the SSP1-2.6. Future changes mostly progress monotonically from the weakest to the strongest forcing scenario, and from the mid-century to late-century projection period. There is an increase in the seasonality of the intra-annual precipitation distribution, as the wetter part of the year contributes relatively more to the annual total. Furthermore, an increasingly heavy-tailed precipitation distribution and a rightward shifted temperature distribution provide strong indications of a more intense hydrological cycle as greenhouse gas emissions increase. The relative distance of an individual GCM from the ensemble mean does not substantially vary across different scenarios. We found no clear systematic linkage between model spread about the mean in the reference period and the magnitude of simulated sub-regional climate change in the future period. Overall, these results could be useful for regional climate change impact assessments across South America.","2021-06","2023-09-26 16:12:10","2023-09-26 16:12:10","","155-183","","2","5","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000662852400001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;60<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;61<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;108</p>","","","VARIABILITY; CMIP6; DROUGHT; Climate change; LOW-LEVEL JET; South America; REGIONAL CLIMATE; SCENARIO; TROPICAL ANDES; GLACIER; Global climate models; INCREASES; RAINFALL EXTREME EVENTS; TIME SCALE INTERACTIONS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Coledale Beck catchment in northwest England was subject to an extreme rainfall event in December 2015 that equated to a 1 in 200-year event. The catchment contains the UK's first passive metal mine water treatment system, and as such had been subject to intense monitoring of solute dynamics before and after commissioning. Due to this monitoring record, the site provides a unique opportunity to assess the effects of a major storm event on (1) catchment-scale solute transport, and (2) the resilience of the new and novel passive treatment system to extreme events. Monitoring suggests a modest decline in treatment efficiency over time that is not synchronous with the storm event and explained instead by changes in system hydraulic efficiency. There was no apparent flushing of the mine system during the event that could potentially have compromised treatment system performance. Analysis of metal transport in the catchment downstream of the mine suggests relatively subtle changes in instream chemistry with modest but statistically-significant reductions in zinc in the lower catchment irrespective of flow condition after the extreme event, but most parameters of interest show no significant change. Increased export of colloidal iron and aluminium is associated with major landslips in the mid-catchment after the storm and provide fresh sorption sites to attenuate dissolved zinc more rapidly in these locations, corroborated by laboratory experiments utilising site materials to investigate the attenuation/release of metals from stream and terrestrial sediments. The data are important as they show both the resilience of passive mine water treatment systems to extreme events and the importance of catchment-scale monitoring to ensure continued effectiveness of treatment initiatives after major perturbation.

Ensuring appropriate governance structures, mechanisms and resources to facilitate these decisions is therefore essential. Based on a systematic literature review by van der Heijden (2019), this paper develops a simple framework to assess the state of ten enabling factors for effective urban climate governance, and applies it to low-carbon passenger mobility in London. Drawing on documentary evidence and a series of semi-structured expert interviews, it finds that London's city authorities have a strong capacity for autonomy, stakeholder participation, local leadership and coordination on climate action and mobility, of which they make extensive use. The national legal and political framework remains broadly supportive following the UK's departure from the EU, but multi-level co-ordination is thin, and funding issues have intensified conflict over political jurisdiction since the pandemic began. Spatial variation in urban form and infrastructure, coupled with dual-layer city administration, complicate the socio-political landscape and drive for climate action in mobility.","2021-03","2023-09-26 16:12:10","2023-09-26 16:12:10","","","","5","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000628593600001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;99</p>","","","climate change; climate governance; local government; urban transport","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such worry is one of several possible psychological responses (e.g., fear, anxiety, depression, and trauma) to climate change. Within this article, the psychometric development of the ten-item Climate Change Worry Scale (CCWS) is detailed in three studies. The scale was developed to assess proximal worry about climate change rather than social or global impacts. Study 1 provided evidence that the CCWS items were internally consistent, constituted a single factor, and that the facture structure of the items was invariant for men and women. The results from Study 1 also indicated a good fit with a Rasch model of the items. Study 2 affirmed the internal consistency of the CCWS items and indicated that peoples' responses to the measure were temporally stable over a two-week test-retest interval (r = 0.91). Study 3 provided support for the convergent and divergent validity of the CCWS through its pattern of correlations with several established clinical and weather-related measures. The limitations of the studies and the possible uses of the CCWS were discussed.

Global warming and land use changes influence the hydrological regime. This effect is especially strong in cold regions. In this study, we used long-term hydrological monitoring data (22-26 years) from small agricultural catchments in Norway. We applied a Mann-Kendall trend and wavelet coherence analysis to detect annual and seasonal changes and to evaluate the coupling between runoff, climate, and water sources. The trend analysis showed a significant increase in the annual and seasonal mean air temperature. In all sites, hydrological changes were more difficult to detect. Discharge increased in autumn and winter, but this trend did not hold for all catchments. We found a strong coherence between discharge and precipitation, between discharge and snow water equivalent and discharge and soil water storage capacity. We detected different hydrological regimes of rain and snow-dominated catchments. The catchments responded differently to changes due to their location and inherent characteristics. Our results highlight the importance of studying local annual and seasonal changes in hydrological regimes to understand the effect of climate and the importance for site-specific management plans.","2021-12","2023-09-26 16:12:10","2023-09-26 16:12:10","","1542-1558","","6","52","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000714145700001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;49</p>","","","climate change; TRENDS; WATER-QUALITY; PRECIPITATION; RUNOFF; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SNOW; trends; SURFACE; water management; NITROGEN; coherence; cold climate; DOMINATED CATCHMENTS; WAVELET COHERENCE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this review, we synthesize current understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms that can give rise to AA. These mechanisms include both local feedbacks and changes in poleward energy transport. Temperature and sea ice-related feedbacks are especially important for AA, since they are significantly more positive over the Arctic than at lower latitudes. Changes in energy transport by the atmosphere and ocean can also contribute to AA. These energy transport changes are tightly coupled with local feedbacks, and thus their respective contributions to AA should not be considered in isolation. It is here emphasized that the feedbacks and energy transport changes that give rise to AA are sensitively dependent on the state of the climate system itself. This implies that changes in the climate state will lead to changes in the strength of AA, with implications for past and future climate change.","2021-09","2023-09-26 16:12:10","2023-09-26 16:12:10","","","","9","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000692002100001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;103<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;103<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;264</p>","","","climate change; climate feedbacks; SURFACE AIR-TEMPERATURE; POLAR AMPLIFICATION; ALBEDO FEEDBACK; arctic amplification; ATMOSPHERIC HEAT-TRANSPORT; CO2 CONCENTRATION; ENERGY-TRANSPORT; GLOBAL CLIMATE; GREENHOUSE-PLUS FEEDBACK; polar amplification; RADIATIVE FEEDBACKS; SEA-ICE LOSS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this review, we bring together climate adaptation, decolonising and intersectional scholarship to chart the progress that has been made in better analysing and responding to climate change in Indigenous contexts. We identify a wealth of literature helping to decolonise climate adaptation scholarship and praxis by attending to colonial and neo-colonial injustices implicated in Indigenous peoples' climate vulnerability, taking seriously Indigenous peoples' relational ontologies, and promoting adaptation that draws on Indigenous capacities and aspirations for self-determination and cultural continuity. Despite calls to interrogate heterogenous experiences of climate change within Indigenous communities, the decolonising climate and adaptation scholarship has made limited advances in this area. We examine the small body of research that takes an intersectional approach to climate adaptation and explores how the multiple subjectivities and identities that Indigenous peoples occupy produce unique vulnerabilities, capacities and encounters with adaptation policy. We suggest the field might be expanded by drawing on related studies from Indigenous development, natural resource management, conservation, feminism, health and food sovereignty. Greater engagement with intersectionality works to drive innovation in decolonising climate adaptation scholarship and practice. It can mitigate the risk of maladaptation, avoid entrenchment of inequitable power dynamics, and ensures that even the most marginal groups within Indigenous communities benefit from adaptation policies and programmes.","2022-09","2023-09-26 16:12:09","2023-09-26 16:12:09","","1541-1578","","3","5","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000849068200001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;8<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;8<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;391</p>","","","climate change; GENDER; Climate adaptation; ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE; ADAPTIVE CAPACITY; CHANGE VULNERABILITY; COMMUNITY-BASED RESEARCH; decolonisation; HUMAN DIMENSIONS; Indigenous peoples; intersectionality; MENTAL-HEALTH; NEW-ZEALAND; POLITICAL ECOLOGY; TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The transition to low-carbon hospitals requires detailed knowledge of the amount and sources of GHG emissions. This study aimed at capturing the status quo of GHG emission reporting by German hospitals and at examining characteristics of the reports. Therefore, we performed a grey literature review with pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The search strategy comprised hand-searching specific databases, targeted websites and web search engines via a standardized set of search terms. We found 232 German hospitals reporting their GHG emissions, representing 12% of all hospitals. Yet, only 62 hospitals (3%) met the inclusion criteria for further analysis. These reports do not comprise all energy-related GHG emissions, omit GHG emissions occurring up- and downstream of hospitals and mainly include CO2, but leave out other GHG. Consequently, there are severe gaps regarding GHG emissions reports of German hospitals.

Changes in rainfall pattern will inevitably occur due to rising temperatures caused by climate change, which has a direct impact on the distribution of Australia's vegetation (green cover). As variability in rainfall continues to increase, i.e., in frequency and/or magnitude, due to climate change, extreme climate events such as droughts are predicted to become more pervasive and severe that will have an adverse effect on vegetation. This study investigates the effects of extreme climate on Australia's green cover during 2003-2018 for the end of rainy seasons of April and October in the northern and southern parts, respectively, to (i) determine the state of vegetation and its changes, (ii) identify ""hotspots"", i.e., regions that constantly experienced statistically significant decrease in NDVI, and (iii), relate changes in the identified hotspots to GRACE-hydrological changes. These are achieved through the exploitation of the statistical tools of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Mann-Kendel Test on Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) hydrological products on the one hand, and the utilization of Australia's rainfall product and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (MODIS-NDVI) used here with its native spatial resolution of 0.002413 degrees x 0.002413 degrees on the other hand. Differences between 3-year intervals from 2003 to 2018 for both April and October datasets are used to quantify vegetation variations. Through area change analysis, the vegetation differences (2003-2018) indicate that April exhibited larger increase (13.77% of total vegetation area) than decrease (7.83%) compared to October, which experienced slightly larger decrease (9.41%) than increase (8.71%). South Australia and Western Australia emerge as ""hotspots"" in which vegetation statistically decreased in October, with no noticeable change in April.

The gauge based temperature (CN05.1) and precipitation data (APHRODITE) are used to validate the performance of PRECIS. The results show that PRECIS has better performance in reproducing the present climatology in spatial distribution and annual cycle than its driving GCM, particularly in some cold months and the high latitude regions, though the simulation is worse in precipitation over the high-cold Tibet Plateau of China. Compared to the observation, the difference between the simulations at 50 km (R50) and 25 km (R25) resolutions is very small. Projected annual temperature and precipitation will increase gradually with the time over most regions of China, especially in the late of this century. The results from R25 show the mean temperature over China will increase by similar to 1.3(1.5) degrees C in the early century, 2.7(3.5) degrees C in the middle century, and 3.5(5.9) degrees C in the late century under RCP4.5(8.5), which are all smaller than the values from its driving GCM. Most models project that the temperature will have more increases in cold months (i.e., January to March) while the southeastern region will show smaller changes relative to other sub-regions. Additionally, China will receive more precipitation from the overall trend, but the increased amplitude among different concentration scenarios and models are different obviously. The projections from R25 show more precipitation than the R50 and their driving GCM. For instance, the annual mean precipitation will increase by similar to 15(22) % for GCM, similar to 20(33) % for R50 and similar to 22(37) % for R25 in the late of this century over the entire China under RCP4.5(8.5). The annual cycles of precipitation at subregions also show a distinct variation. The changes are smaller in October or November than other months for the southeastern and central regions, while the percentage change is larger in the northwest, which will alleviate the pressure of water shortage in this arid region of China.","2021-02","2023-09-26 16:12:09","2023-09-26 16:12:09","","","","","249","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000596388600002","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;14<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;15<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;37</p>","","","DROUGHT; Climate change; EXTREMES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; China; Temperature; Precipitation; EVENTS; Regional climate model; RESOLUTION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, what constitutes climate denial has evolved considerably from its original ascription for those who deny the physical science of anthropogenic global warming. This paper unpacks the multiple contemporary meanings of climate denial to examine whether this moniker can correlate with rational action (i.e. principled action logically derived from reliable knowledge), and how rationality can be deployed when pursuing political priorities that conflict with the orthodox normative positions of experts. Valid modes of rationality are diverse and not the sole preserve of those proponents of transformative and/or unified climate change action. Modes of rationality are also intimately linked to problem framing. Experts' existing problem-frames may actually facilitate Deniers' avoidance of the sorts of rationalisations that experts wish them to make. By better understanding the rationalities pertaining to the climate change debate, the paper concludes, experts and advocates can tailor their communication to more effectively influence the design of effective policies. A better understanding of how Climate Deniers can be rational and how rationalisation relates to problem framing may be necessary to address the most polarised politics of the climate crisis.","2021-11-17","2023-09-26 16:12:09","2023-09-26 16:12:09","","1077-1091","","8","15","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000684499600001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;65</p>","","","Climate change; SCIENCE; POLITICS; climate communication; denial; EXPERTISE; policymaking; rational actor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aims to assess the potential influences of climate change on extreme rainfall characteristics in flood-vulnerable city of Adama. Daily precipitation records of 1967-2016 and projection of global circulation models (GCMs): CanESM2 and HadCM3 for 2021-2070 were disaggregated into shorter time resolutions using the Hyetos model. Gumbel type I probability distribution and power-regression model (i = aD(b)) were used for deducing intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves and for describing their functions, respectively. The extreme rainfall intensity of the historical and future periods for a range of storm durations and return periods were compared and contrasted. A close agreement is obtained between the observed and the modeled rainfall intensity with high values of coefficient of determination (> 0.996) and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (> 0.850). Besides, statistically significant (p < 0.05) direct linear relationship is found between the return periods and the coefficient parameter of the IDF models. Moreover, the intensity of extreme precipitation over 2021-2070 in Adama city would increase up to 49.5%, depending on storm duration and return period considered. This could have consequences of the way the city's drainage infrastructures are designed, operated, and sustained. Hence, flood-prone areas should be recognized in order to formulate effective strategies for mitigation and adaption of potential impacts. The standards for designing future drainage infrastructures should also be updated aiming to reflect the effects of climatic change.","2021-12","2023-09-26 16:12:09","2023-09-26 16:12:09","","","","12","193","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000716447500001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;59</p>","","","Climate change; MODEL; QUANTIFICATION; WEATHER; Climate extreme; Flood hazard; IDF CURVES; Precipitation intensity; RAINFALL DISAGGREGATION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This reflects high exposure to hydroclimatic hazards such as tropical cyclones, floods, droughts, and heatwaves. Rapidly growing cities and low-lying coastal zones/estuaries also face threats from sea level rise and storm surges. However, climate model projections remain very uncertain about most of these risks, so water infrastructure and operations need to consider a range of plausible futures. Against this background, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been developing frameworks, tools, and capacities in climate risk and adaptation assessment and management. Project teams are often operating in data-scarce situations and under significant time constraints, so the emphasis has been on creating pragmatic guidance and training resources. This paper charts the transition of climate risk management (CRM) within the ADB from a predominantly scenario-led to decision-led approach to adaptation. Examples are given of light-touch procedures for screening climate risks, strengthening the transparency and rigour of scenario analysis, raising awareness of a broad range of adaptation options, streamlining identification of CRM options, and embedding allowances for climate change in detailed engineering designs. Such practical innovations would benefit communities of practice beyond the Asia-Pacific region.","2021-12","2023-09-26 16:12:09","2023-09-26 16:12:09","","10-30","","","23","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000712455500001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;70</p>","","","Climate change; SIMULATIONS; UNCERTAINTY; INFORMATION; IMPACTS; Adaptation; Asia; WATER MANAGEMENT; Climate allowance; Risk management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper takes advantage of a unique dataset that includes surveys from activists who organized the nationally coordinated climate strikes in the US that began in spring 2019 to answer these questions. Building on the research about collective identity formation online and the role that hashtags play, we employ social network analysis to assess how collective identity forms online over three waves of protests. In particular, we analyze how activists involved in the youth climate movement used hashtags to project their collective identities and create collective narratives. Our findings show how hashtags use varied over the period of our study, in some cases indicating the formation of a thin collective identity. They also show that there are patterns in the ways hashtags are employed by activists in the movement that suggest the formation of subaltern narratives among those affiliated with youth-led groups.

Reliable climate model simulations of past and future climate change depend crucially upon them. Here we analyze large ensembles of simulations using a comprehensive Earth System Model to quantify uncertainties in global climate change attributable to differences in prescribed forcings. The different forcings considered here are those used in the two most recent phases of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP), namely CMIP5 and CMIP6. We show significant differences in simulated global surface air temperature due to volcanic aerosol forcing in the second half of the 19th century and in the early 21st century. The latter arise from small-to-moderate eruptions incorporated in CMIP6 simulations but not in CMIP5 simulations. We also find significant differences in global surface air temperature and Arctic sea ice area due to anthropogenic aerosol forcing in the second half of the 20th century and early 21st century. These differences are as large as those obtained in different versions of an Earth System Model employing identical forcings. In simulations from 2015 to 2100, we find significant differences in the rates of projected global warming arising from CMIP5 and CMIP6 concentration pathways that differ slightly but are equivalent in terms of their nominal radiative forcing levels in 2100. Our results highlight the influence of assumptions about natural and anthropogenic aerosol loadings on carbon budgets, the likelihood of meeting Paris targets, and the equivalence of future forcing scenarios.","2021-06-08","2023-09-26 16:12:09","2023-09-26 16:12:09","","","","23","118","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000684996200025","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;34<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;34<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;37</p>","","","climate change; CMIP5; climate model; EXPERIMENTAL-DESIGN; external forcing; INTERCOMPARISON PROJECT; large ensemble","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The energy transition is now an important topic and problem, especially in Poland. (1) The undertaken analysis of the problem of energy transition is important for political, social and technological reasons. Political, because it shows the weakness of the implementation of Polish energy policy in regards to climate change. Social, because energy transition will bring about significant social changes in the largest industrial region of Poland. Technological, as the departure from fossil fuels requires the introduction of other sources of energy on a massive scale, for which Poland is not prepared. The aim of the study was to critically analyse the activities to date in the field of energy transition in Poland. The second goal of the analysis was an attempt to answer the question of whether the process of energy transition and achieving the goals set in the EU's European Green Deal are possible at all until 2050. (2) To achieve the goals, the system method and the decision-making method were primarily used. These methods allowed for an examination of the main determinants of the Polish energy transformation. (3) The main results include the confirmation, contrary to the announcements of the Polish government, that despite the adoption in Poland of the strategy ""Poland's energy policy until 2040"", the effective implementation of the energy transition before 2050 is not only very difficult, but may even be impossible to implement in the assumed time. This is due to political, economic, social and technological conditions. Coal energy is outdated, expensive and ineffective. Due to natural conditions, wind energy is not able to meet the energy demand of the industry. The development of nuclear energy is only in the planning phase. (4) To sum up, in the next thirty years, Poland will not be able to achieve the assumed effects of the energy transition, which is in contradiction with the official declaration of the government.","2021-12","2023-09-26 16:12:08","2023-09-26 16:12:08","","","","23","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000735032300001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;14<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;14<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;106</p>","","","climate change; MODEL; climate policy; POWER; European Union; CARBON; PERSPECTIVES; CLIMATE POLICY; COEVOLUTION; EDUCATION; energy transition; EUROPEAN-UNION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the sustainability of these landscapes is threatened by climate change. Whilst adopting climate-smart (CS) practices clearly offers direct benefits to local farmers, their greater benefits at landscape and global scales has not been studied for specific commodity crops so far. Our research uniquely outlines how local adoption of CS-practices in coffee-farming systems provides local, landscape and global benefits. We review literature on CS agriculture, CS landscapes, and coffee farming to firstly identify the different CS-practices applicable to coffee farming systems, and then group these into functional groups that represent the main functional trait targeted by different practices within coffee-farming systems. This allows identifying benefits provided at local, landscape and global scales. The seven functional groups identified are: soil characteristics; water management; crop and genetic diversity; climate buffer and adjustment; crop nutrient management; structural elements and natural habitats; and system functioning. Benefits offered at landscape and global scales (non-exhaustively) include improved water quality, biodiversity conservation and habitat connectivity, as well as stabilized regional climate patterns. Our review shows that regulating services are especially pronounced, although the extent of benefits provided depend on landscape coordination. We discuss considerations for managing possible conflicts, coordinating actions, financing and accommodating lead time. Local farmers, policy-makers and global donors must unite to improve uptake of CS coffee-production practices in a coordinated way, to thereby augment and safeguard coffee-farming's socio-ecological system along with associated local, landscape and global benefits.","2021-11-25","2023-09-26 16:12:08","2023-09-26 16:12:08","","","","","3","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001019299500001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;80</p>","","","ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; BIODIVERSITY; IMPACT; resilience; OPPORTUNITIES; MITIGATION; CHANGE ADAPTATION; AGRICULTURE; climate change adaptation; CONSERVATION; climate change mitigation; climate-smart landscapes; coffee; landscape services; PRINCIPLES; socio-ecological system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While climate change is a concern to all Canadians, Indigenous communities in Canada have been disproportionately more affected by these extreme climate events than non-Indigenous communities. As the impacts of climate change intensify, it becomes increasingly important that high-resolution climate services are made available to Indigenous decision makers for the development of climate change adaptation plans. This paper examined extreme climate trends in the Six Nations of the Grand River reserve, the most populated Indigenous community in Canada. A set of 12 indices were used to evaluate changes in extreme climate events from 1951 to 2013, and 2006 to 2099 under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5. Results indicated that from 1951 to 2013, Six Nations became warmer and wetter with an average temperature increase of 0.7 degrees C and precipitation increase of 42 mm. Over this period, the frequency and duration of extreme heat and extreme precipitation events also increased, while extreme cold events decreased. In the future (2006 to 2099), temperature is expected to increase by 3 to 6 degrees C, while seasonal precipitation is expected to increase in winter, early spring, and fall. Projected rate of increase of heatwaves is 0.4 to 1.5 days per year and extreme annual rainfall events is 0.2 to 0.5 mm per year under both RCP scenarios.

Diagnostic analyses reveal that the moisture budget and thermodynamic energy equations related to the Delta P ' and Delta omega ' proposed separately in previous studies are simultaneously tenable. As a result, we investigate the mechanism for the spatial pattern of Delta omega ' from the perspective of the moist static energy (MSE) balance mainly considering the positive contribution from vertical advection. Therefore, based on the simplified MSE balance, the spatial pattern of Delta omega ' can be approximately projected based on three factors: background circulation variability omega ', the vertical gradient of mean-state MSE M over bar , and its future change Delta M over bar . Under global warming, the middle-level vertical gradient of MSE increases slightly over the Indian Ocean and the Maritime Continent and decreases over the equatorial Pacific where the increase in sea surface temperature (SST) exceeds the tropical mean. The vertical gradient of mean-state MSE is modified by the increase in vertical gradients of moisture and dry static energy (DSE) simultaneously. In short, the change in the vertical gradient of mean-state MSE under global warming can influence the moisture budget and thermodynamic energy balances, resulting in the spatial pattern of Delta P ' and Delta omega ' at intraseasonal and interannual time scales consequently, mainly determined by the lower boundary moisture condition in the response of the SST change pattern.","2021-06","2023-09-26 16:12:08","2023-09-26 16:12:08","","4495-4504","","11","34","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000648587900017","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;41</p>","","","Climate change; CLIMATE-CHANGE; IMPACTS; CMIP5; Climate models; PROPAGATION; Interannual variability; Intraseasonal variability; MADDEN-JULIAN OSCILLATION; MJO; PACIFIC RAINFALL VARIABILITY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present study is an attempt to explore the views of local farmers on climate change and uncertainty and evaluating their prevalent coping strategies in the Chengalpet district of Tamil Nadu, a semi-arid expanse of South India. In order to achieve this objective, Rapid Rural Appraisals (RRAs), Focal Group Discussions (FGDs) and In-Depth Surveys (IDS) were conducted. Through RRA, this research identifies farmers' perceptions of climate change and its impacts and highlights how farmers respond to it through adaptations and brings to light the adaptation needs and obstacles faced by the vulnerable coastal agro ecosystems of the state. The study indicated that majority of the farmers have observed climatic variability and change through rises in temperature, extended dry spells, rise in heat stress on crops, etc. The study explored that the farmers are practicing autonomous adaptation strategies like varying planting dates, adoption of heat resistant crops and varieties, switch from conventional paddy cultivation to other cash crops, agroforestry, etc. Farmers are cultivating tree species such as eucalyptus, teak wood, Casuarinafor multipurpose use planted along with various annual crops like cereals, banana, jasmine, cluster beans, maize, etc. This supports them to abate short term risks, sustain their livelihood and works as a long-term investment. The farmers are facing various social hurdles to adaptation options like lack of timely information regarding effective adaptation options from extension officers, lack of crop-weather insurances and micro-financing facilities, etc., apart from climate change risks. With regards to the sources of information regarding adaptation options, there is a strong need to enhance agriculture extension services in the remote areas. SWOT analysis revealed dwindling crop area for cultivation/natural resources, poor dissemination of weather/climate forecasts, reluctance of the young generation to take up farming as their living, etc., as some of the major threats. In order to prioritize the best and viable adaptation that suits, the research zone pairwise ranking method was used. This study recommends modification of farming practices, switching over to different crops and efficient water management as site-specific adaptation interventions as per pair-wise ranking of adaptations. These site specific strategies have to be implemented in the region to meet the challenges that lie ahead due to future climatic change and livelihood insecurity.","2022-06","2023-09-26 16:12:08","2023-09-26 16:12:08","","291-308","","2","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000668025800004","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;71</p>","","","VARIABILITY; Climate change; RESPONSES; IMPACTS; Adaptation; WATER-RESOURCES; STRATEGIES; VULNERABILITY; AGRICULTURE; Climate variability; Resilience; Perceptions; ADAPTIVE CAPACITY; Agroforestry; SMALLHOLDER FARMERS; TAMIL-NADU","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study outlines a new approach for developing more robust and quantitative hydroclimate records, and also highlights that precipitation ""whiplash"" is a ubiquitous feature of California's climate that we must prepare for, especially given the likelihood that human-caused climate change is already increasing the frequency and severity of hydrologic extremes.","2021-12-16","2023-09-26 16:12:08","2023-09-26 16:12:08","","","","23","48","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000730019700064","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;41</p>","","","climate change; VARIABILITY; DROUGHT; INSIGHTS; precipitation; US; UNITED-STATES; CALCIUM ISOTOPES; California climate; hydroclimate; NEVADA; paleoclimate; SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA; SPELEOTHEM; speleothems; WESTERN NORTH-AMERICA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In North America, decreases in the frequency and intensity of extreme winter cold events are expected to allow the poleward range expansion of many cold-sensitive tropical organisms, sometimes at the expense of temperate organisms. Although ecologists have long noted the critical ecological role of winter cold temperature extremes in tropical-temperate transition zones, the ecological effects of extreme cold events have been understudied, and the influence of warming winter temperatures has too often been left out of climate change vulnerability assessments. Here, we examine the influence of extreme cold events on the northward range limits of a diverse group of tropical organisms, including terrestrial plants, coastal wetland plants, coastal fishes, sea turtles, terrestrial reptiles, amphibians, manatees, and insects. For these organisms, extreme cold events can lead to major physiological damage or landscape-scale mass mortality. Conversely, the absence of extreme cold events can foster population growth, range expansion, and ecological regime shifts. We discuss the effects of warming winters on species and ecosystems in tropical-temperate transition zones. In the 21st century, climate change-induced decreases in the frequency and intensity of extreme cold events are expected to facilitate the poleward range expansion of many tropical species. Our review highlights critical knowledge gaps for advancing understanding of the ecological implications of the tropicalization of temperate ecosystems in North America.","2021-07","2023-09-26 16:12:08","2023-09-26 16:12:08","","3009-3034","","13","27","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000629656000001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;74<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;76<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;339</p>","","","climate change; range expansion; climate extreme; extreme cold events; poleward migration; tropicalization; warming; winter climate change","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the past few decades, previous studies have analyzed the spatiotemporal variability of Arctic inversions, but few studies have investigated changes in temperature inversions. In this study, the changes in the depth of Arctic inversions in the mid-twenty-first century are projected based on a 30-member ensemble from the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble (CESM-LE) project. The ERA-Interim, JRA-55, and NCEP-NCAR reanalysis were employed to verify the model results. The CESM-LE can adequately reproduce the spatial distribution and trends of present-day inversion depth in the Arctic, and the simulation is better in winter. The mean inversion depth in the CESM-LE is slightly underestimated, and the discrepancy is less than 11 hPa, within a reasonable range. The model results show that during the mid-twenty-first century, the inversion depth will strongly decrease in autumn and slightly decrease in winter. The shallowing of the inversion is most obvious over the Arctic Ocean, and the maximum decrease is over 65 hPa in the Pacific sector in autumn. In contrast, the largest decrease in the inversion depth, which is more than 45 hPa, occurs over the Barents Sea in winter. Moreover, the area where the inversion shallows is consistent with the area where the sea ice is retreating, indicating that the inversion depth over the Arctic Ocean in autumn and winter is likely regulated by the sea ice extent through modulating surface heat fluxes.","2021-05","2023-09-26 16:12:08","2023-09-26 16:12:08","","4159-4168","","10","34","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000644153200025","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;42</p>","","","VARIABILITY; Climate change; MODEL; SIMULATIONS; Climate prediction; Arctic climate change; AEROSOLS; Arctic temperature; Boundary layer; CESM; CLEAR-SKY; GASES; inversion; MASS-BALANCE; Model evaluation; performance; STRENGTH","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we implement a readily portable procedure for building an upgradable long-term homogeneous climate dataset using monthly and daily observations of temperature and precipitation over a given area of interest, exemplified here with Abruzzo, a region in Central Italy characterized by complex orography. We process the dataset according to a preliminary ranking of stations based on data quantity and quality, and we exploit the Climatol algorithm for inhomogeneity correction. The corrected time series show trends in broad agreement with external databases (CRU, Berkeley Earth, E-OBS), and highlight the importance of relying on a local network for a better representation of gradients and variability over the territory. We estimate that maximum (TX) and minimum temperature (TN) increased by similar to 1.6 and similar to 2.2 degrees C/century, respectively, over the period 1930-2019, while in the recent decades 1980-2019 we found an accelerated trend of similar to 5.7 and similar to 3.9 degrees C/century. Precipitation (RR) decreased by similar to 10%/century in 1930-2019, while it has been increasing at a rate of similar to 26%/century in 1980-2019. The Koppen-Geiger climate classification is sensitive to the increase of precipitation in the recent decades, which is attributable to decreased summer precipitation overcompensated by more rain in late spring and early autumn. The cold climate types are retreating upwards along the slopes of the mountain ranges. Over the period 1980-2019, extreme values are also displaying significant trends. Every 2 years, there is one less frost day (TN <0 degrees C) and one more summer day (TX >25 degrees C) in the Apennines area, while there is one more tropical night (TN >20 degrees C) in the Adriatic coastal area. Precipitation extremes are increasing, especially along the coast, with rain accumulated in the rainiest days increasing at a rate of 1-2%/year.","2021-06-30","2023-09-26 16:12:08","2023-09-26 16:12:08","","4414-4436","","8","41","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000633931400001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;16<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;16<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;53</p>","","","TEMPERATURE; PRECIPITATION; climate classification; climate change detection indices; climate time series; climate trend; HOMOGENEITY; homogenization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We assessed a commonly used online decision support tool, NatureServe's Climate Change Vulnerability Index (CCVI) and its sensitivity to different generations of climate models, socioeconomic climate scenarios, and different types and scales of spatial data. Our goal was to help mangers better interpret CCVI species vulnerability rankings and provide a workflow for generating the required climate metrics when those data are not already calculated. We found vulnerability scores were much larger when using an older generation as compared to a newer generation of climate projections, especially for water associated species. Socioeconomic climate scenarios were very important and resulted in differences of 130% between optimistic and pessimistic scenarios. Hence, we caution when comparing across studies to consider the generation of climate models and scenarios because the scores may not be directly comparable. The online tool was robust to the type and scale of spatial data. However, this data is only applied in calculating exposure and is not included in species specific sensitivity via adaptive capacity. Consequently, we suggest that managers use range size as an index of adaptive capacity when interpreting similar scores. Overall, we find the species climate vulnerability model supported by NatureServe a valuable and robust assessment that is easy to use and provides an objective method for prioritizing conservation action and justifying these actions to policy makers and the general public.","2021-04","2023-09-26 16:12:08","2023-09-26 16:12:08","","","","","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000664759000005","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;40</p>","","","Climate change; RISK; EXTINCTION; PHENOLOGY; Climate models; RANGE; LESSONS; ADAPTATION STRATEGIES; CCVI; Climate vulnerability; Herpetofauna; PHYSIOLOGY; Spatial scale","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because it explicitly incorporates uncertainty, scenario planning is regularly employed in climate change adaptation. An early and essential step in developing scenarios is identifying ""climate futures""-descriptions of the physical attributes of plausible future climates that could occur at a specific place and time. Divergent climate futures that describe the broadest possible range of plausible conditions support information needs of decision makers, including understanding the spectrum of potential resource responses to climate change, developing strategies robust to that range, avoiding highly consequential surprises, and averting maladaptation. Here, we discuss three approaches for generating climate futures: a Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)-ensemble, a quadrant-average, and an individual-projection approach. All are designed to capture relevant uncertainty, but they differ in utility for different applications, complexity, and effort required to implement. Using an application from Big Bend National Park as an example of numerous similar efforts to develop climate futures for National Park Service applications over the past decade, we compare these approaches, focusing on their ability to capture among-projection divergence during early-, mid-, and late-twenty-first century periods to align with near-, mid-, and long-term planning efforts. The quadrant-average approach and especially the individual-projection approach captured a broader range of plausible future conditions than the RCP-ensemble approach, particularly in the near term. Therefore, the individual-projection approach supports decision makers seeking to understand the broadest potential characterization of future conditions. We discuss tradeoffs associated with different climate future approaches and highlight suitable applications.","2021-08","2023-09-26 16:12:08","2023-09-26 16:12:08","","","","3-4","167","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000686356600001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;9<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;9<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;64</p>","","","Climate change; CMIP5; CHANGE SCENARIOS; Climate adaptation; CONSERVATION; Climate projection; Climate futures; HISTORICAL SIMULATIONS; NORTH-AMERICAN CLIMATE; Resource management; Scenario planning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A thorough understanding of all climate-dependent aspects will help in designing dwellings appropriately in different climate zones. In addition, a methodology that facilitates the establishment of a typology of climate-oriented research is presented. This typology can be used in future research in different scientific areas.

We use regression analysis to quantify the links between Arctic sea ice and midlatitude winter climate in observations and large initial-condition ensembles of multiple climate models, in both coupled configurations and so-called Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) configurations, where observed sea ice and/or sea surface temperatures are prescribed. The coupled models capture the observed links in interannual variability between winter Barents-Kara sea ice and Eurasian surface temperature, and between winter Chukchi-Bering sea ice and North American surface temperature. The coupled models also capture the delayed connection between reduced November-December Barents-Kara sea ice, a weakened winter stratospheric polar vortex, and a shift toward the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation in late winter, although this downward impact is weaker than observed. The strength and sign of the connections both vary considerably between individual 35-yr-long ensemble members, highlighting the need for large ensembles to separate robust connections from internal variability. All the aforementioned links are either absent or are substantially weaker in the AMIP experiments prescribed with only observed sea ice variability. We conclude that the causal effects of sea ice variability on midlatitude winter climate are much weaker than suggested by statistical associations, evident in observations and coupled models, because the statistics are inflated by the effects of atmospheric circulation variability on sea ice.","2021-04","2023-09-26 16:12:07","2023-09-26 16:12:07","","3021-3038","","8","34","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000644147200012","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;30<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;30<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;71</p>","","","TEMPERATURE; Climate change; IMPACT; AMPLIFICATION; Climate models; WEATHER; Climate variability; Arctic; ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION RESPONSE; COLD WINTERS; Sea ice; Teleconnections","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Scholars and policymakers debate which approaches should be undertaken to Leave Fossil Fuels Underground (LFFU). However, existing scholarship has not yet inventoried and evaluated the array of approaches to LFFU based on their effectiveness, equity, or feasibility. Hence, this review article asks: What lessons can we learn from reviewing scholarship on proposed approaches to leaving fossil fuels underground (LFFU)? We identify 28 unique LFFU approaches, of which only 12 are deemed environmentally effective (e.g., fossil fuel extraction taxes, bans and moratoria, and financial swaps); eight involve moderate-to-high (non-)monetary costs, and only four are deemed entirely just and equitable. Of the 12 environmentally effective approaches: only three were deemed cost-effective (regulating financial capital for fossil fuel projects, removing existing fossil fuel subsidies, and bans & moratoria); merely four were deemed equitable (asset write-offs, retiring existing fossil infrastructure, pursuing court cases/litigation, and financial swaps); and all were deemed institutionally problematic in terms of their feasibility (six were challenging to implement as they threatened the vested interests of powerful stakeholder groups). Moreover, the reviewed scholarship draws heavily on empirical studies of how these LFFU approaches can be optimized in European, North American, and Chinese contexts; fewer studies have explored the effectiveness and fairness of LFFU approaches in the South and/or in a North-South context. Future research should particularly focus on North-South fossil fuel financial flows, which have received comparatively little attention.

However, most studies work with global circulation models, being of little use in making decisions on the scale of farm management. Given this, the objective of this study was to identify the suitability for the cultivation of C. orobico in the face of climate change and how tree cover mitigates the impacts of climate change in an agroforestry plot. The indices of climatic extremes were calculated (1961 to 2016 for Coatepec; 1985 to 2016 for Briones) and a trend analysis was carried out (Mann-Kendall). The temperature inside a plot, and on an open site, was monitored for two years (2017-2019). This was related to the climatic requirements of C. Arobico. Trends of increase (p < 0.05) of the minimum and minimum extreme annual temperatures were identified in the two stations near the plot (0.24 and 0.69 degrees C.decade(-1) in Coatepec and 0.46 and 0.79 degrees C.decade(-1 )in Briones). The maximum temperature did not present significant increases, reducing the thermal amplitude. Both annual and seasonal precipitation shows trends of increase in intensity. All these conditions are still suitable for the cultivation of C. orobico. At the plot scale, the importance of tree cover is demonstrated, which in this agroforestry system allows to reduce the maximum temperature by 1.9 degrees C compared to an open site. Tree cover has also made it possible to mitigate extreme events.","2022-01","2023-09-26 16:12:07","2023-09-26 16:12:07","","53-62","","1","13","","","","","","","","","","Spanish","","","","WOS:000788200600005","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;64</p>","","","TEMPERATURE; phenology; IMPACTS; REGION; PRECIPITATION EXTREMES; SYSTEMS; AGROFORESTRY; agroforestry system; climate anomalies; climate change indices; climate trends; COULD; SHADE; TRANSPIRATION; VERACRUZ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During winter, species may be especially vulnerable to extreme weather as they are surviving on scarce resources and living at the edge of their thermal limits. We compiled data from eBird, a global citizen science initiative, to examine how 41 eastern North American birds shifted their occurrence and abundance patterns immediately following two recent extreme weather events each affecting > 2 million km(2), the intrusion of a polar vortex and a winter heat wave. eBird data is continuously collected at high spatiotemporal resolution across large spatial extents, allowing us to compare species' responses immediately before and after these extreme events with trends in other winters across geographic scales. Overall, we found that birds responded differently to each extreme weather event. Bird occurrence rates did not change following the polar vortex, but where species occurred, population density was temporarily reduced, suggesting reductions in number of individuals driven by decreases in behavioral activity or temporary movement out of the area. However, birds demonstrated widespread increases in occurrence and increases in density and number of individuals where they occurred for at least 20 days after the heat wave, hinting at longer-term range changes. Smaller-bodied, warm-adapted passerines tended to be most sensitive to extreme weather and responded most negatively to the polar vortex and most positively to the heat wave, while larger-bodied, cold-adapted waterbirds expressed only mild responses to either event. Thus, certain species may be exceptionally sensitive to extreme weather events while others are less sensitive. As climate change progresses and climatic variability increases, researchers and managers must better quantify the broad-scale sensitivity of different species to multiple types of extreme weather events.","2021-08","2023-09-26 16:12:07","2023-09-26 16:12:07","","1143-1155","","8","44","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000646577300001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;8<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;8<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;72</p>","","","climate change; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DIVERSITY; POPULATION; extreme weather; species distribution models; PHYSIOLOGY; climate change ecology; eBird; macroecology; OCCUPANCY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Southeast Asian countries are among those most heavily affected by climate change. The number and intensity of extreme weather events in the region have been increasing markedly, causing severe social and economic damage. Southeast Asian economies are also exposed to gradual effects of global warming as well as transition risks stemming from policies aimed at mitigating climate change. To empirically examine the effect of climate change on the sovereign risk of Southeast Asian countries, we employ indices for vulnerability and resilience to climate change and estimate country-specific OLS models for six countries and a fixed effects panel using monthly data for the period 2002-2018. Both the country-specific and the panel results show that greater climate vulnerability appears to have a sizable positive effect on sovereign bond yields, while greater resilience to climate change has an offsetting effect, albeit to a lesser extent. A higher cost of debt holds back much-needed investment in public infrastructure and climate adaptation, increases the risk of debt sustainability problems, and diminishes the development prospects of Southeast Asian countries.","2021-05","2023-09-26 16:12:07","2023-09-26 16:12:07","","537-551","","3","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000647046600001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;14<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;14<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;43</p>","","","climate change; climate resilience; climate vulnerability; Southeast Asia; COUNTRIES; DEFAULT; sovereign risk","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This was apparent at the 2019 United Nations (UN) Framework Convention on Climate Change - Conference of the Parties (UNFCCC - COP), the largest annual meeting to address the climate crisis via supranational policymaking. COP has convened annually since 1995 in effort to establish international agreements for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and in 2015, was the launch pad for the UN Paris Climate Agreement (PCA). Here, we present our collective perspective as early-career researchers on COP, an institution that we believe plays a critical role in the future of our oceans. Given the current pledges from signatories to the PCA, Earth is expected to warm similar to 3 degrees C by 2100, with the majority of anthropogenic heat content stored throughout the ocean. For this reason, among others, we feel it is crucial for ocean scientists to have a baseline understanding of the negotiations unfolding at COP and within the UNFCCC. We also provide evidence that certain features/structures of COP formalize colonial hierarchies, marginalize certain groups, and threaten to perpetuate the drivers of the environmental crises we all face. Thus, we urge that the future of such gatherings include purposeful and self-reflective acts of restructuring the space they occupy, the solutions they advocate, and the ways in which power is distributed amongst participants. We balance our critique with examples of how this has already been successful at COP, particularly with respect to organizing around ocean-climate issues.","2021-05-11","2023-09-26 16:12:07","2023-09-26 16:12:07","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000651362100005","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;45</p>","","","climate change; climate policy; climate justice; conservation; ocean-climate action; RISKS; United Nations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Incorporating intersectional approaches (e.g., those focused on issues of poverty, place, and race) into public policy may highlight how communities and individuals with fewer resources experience compounded vulnerability to climate-related risks. An intersectional framework yields implications for research and policy in two ways, both broadly and specifically for marginalized groups. First, climate change research and policy would benefit from a more active articulation of intersectionality in its models of adaptation and vulnerability by recognizing groups at high risk for negative outcomes, including distress and displacement. Second, as psychologists document mental health outcomes associated with climate change, engaging in cross-disciplinary discussions will strengthen strategies aimed at reducing mental health disparities.","2021-03","2023-09-26 16:12:07","2023-09-26 16:12:07","","67-75","","1","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000904646600009","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;13<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;13<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;93</p>","","","climate change; climate displacement; intersectionality; climate justice policy; social vulnerability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this research is to make a literature review on the topic of climate change adaptation and building maintenance and use it as the base to point out possible further developments regarding maintenance planning contribution to the adaptation of building stock management. The implementation of maintenance activities with this aim is still incipient and based on theoretical approaches. Despite the scarcity of research on this topic, the literature covers several relevant complementary tools to maintenance planning, also included in the present paper, considering their essential role to the efficient implementation of climate change adapted maintenance.

We analyze the state of climate governance in Germany before the CCA, the main design elements of the CCA, and assess the potential of the CCA to change German climate governance. Drawing on policy integration theory and 26 semi-structured interviews with senior policymakers and stakeholders, we find that German climate governance before the CCA was only moderately integrated. The sectoral emission targets legislated by the CCA make climate change mitigation a priority sector goal in non-energy sectors, and CCA provisions for monitoring, assessing and implementing policy reforms promise to enhance alignment of instruments with targets over time. Overall, the CCA advances a multi- rather than cross-sector climate governance, failing to advance coordination across sectors and ministries.","2021-10-20","2023-09-26 16:12:07","2023-09-26 16:12:07","","118-140","","","30","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000706231100001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;8<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;8<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;58</p>","","","climate policy; climate governance; Climate Change Act; Germany; policy integration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article, therefore, applied a systematic literature review methodology to examine the current climate-water governance archetype, including key areas, major elements, critical gaps, and potential strategy in Pakistan. This study found that key climate-water governance areas in Pakistan are: river basin and watershed management, agriculture and irrigation management, urban and domestic water issues, floods, droughts and disaster management, groundwater management, and transboundary management. Moreover, it is revealed that the major governance elements are political commitment and leadership, policy formulation and regulation, institutional capacity and coordination, stakeholder engagement, and resource management, technology, and infrastructure development. The article also discusses how Pakistan has not effectively employed most of the identified governance elements to tackle its climate-water problems, lacking mostly in political, policy, institutional, coordination, and infrastructure aspects.

The sudden coronavirus global pandemic has also pointed to the importance of tackling the global climate crisis even more urgently. This article discusses six lessons drawn from the COVID-19 pandemic that can inform and facilitate greater future engagement in the global climate crisis. These lessons were identified through monitoring and analyzing media coverage of COVID-19 related events during the initial onset of COVID-19 in late January 2020 to June 30, 2020. The key lessons included the potentiality of reducing fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse emissions, the significance of responding late, a case for strong sustainability, the limits of rugged individualism, a (mis)trust in science, and the possibility of large-scale change.

Managing the risks that arise from changes in the climate over the coming months, years and decades is one of the most pressing challenges that society faces, but there are also some opportunities. The provision and use of climate information in decision-making (i.e. climate services) are central to managing the risks and opportunities. In this article we describe the seemingly complex climate service landscape, the actors in it, what the services are used for, and what next, to help stimulate further action to enable society to reduce risks and realise benefits, particularly timely as the world looks ahead to build a green recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic on the path to net zero emissions. Through a consideration of the value chain for climate services, we emphasise the importance of dialogue and collaboration between those developing, providing and using climate information in decision-making, and stress that a climate service is only worth delivering if it is going to be used by someone to influence an outcome. Co-production can be highly useful for enabling the dialogue and collaborating across the value chain, helping create services based on credible, salient and legitimate knowledge.","2021-08","2023-09-26 16:12:06","2023-09-26 16:12:06","","","","","23","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000703656300001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;19<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;19<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;61</p>","","","Climate change; Climate services; INFORMATION; LEARN; SCIENCE; MODELS; PREDICTION; Climate variability; Risk management; Decision-making; GLOBAL FRAMEWORK","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The former are dominated by the effect of temperature during the colder months of the year, with the energy demand increasing as the temperature decreases. Warming of the UK climate under the influence of anthropogenic forcings is therefore expected to lead to a reduction in domestic energy consumption. Here, we present an end-to-end attribution study that investigates whether the anthropogenic effect on consumption is already evident in the United Kingdom. We analyse data of gas and electricity use in UK households during 2008-2019 and use a simple linear model to express the temperature dependence. Uncertainties in the resulting transfer functions are derived with a recent methodology, originally introduced for downscaling purposes, but adapted here for use in impact studies. The transfer functions are applied to temperature data from simulations with and without the effect of human influence on the climate, generated by 11 state-of-the-art climate models. We thus assess the anthropogenic impact on energy consumption during the reference period by comparing it with what it might have been in a climate without anthropogenic climate change, but at the same level of adaptation. We find that without human influence on the climate, UK households would consume on average about 1,400 kWh more per year, which would increase the annual energy bills by about 70 GBP. Our attribution assessment provides useful evidence of an impact that has already emerged, which can help inform UK's adaptation plans as the climate continues to warm.","2021-11","2023-09-26 16:12:06","2023-09-26 16:12:06","","","","11","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000664425400001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;31</p>","","","DEMAND; climate change impacts; climate change attribution; DATASET; general circulation models; UK energy consumption","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Others have reacted by migrating for work, introducing new crop types, giving up planting certain crops, and investing in irrigation infrastructure. The perception and response strategies of local residents to climate change were mainly influenced by the factors related to geographical characteristics and residents' livelihoods. There are significant differences in perception of climate change among Tibetan, Yi and Naxi, while no significant differences in response strategies have been found among ethnic minorities.

We found that people were anxious about a range of environmental conditions and their personal negative impact on the planet. Notably, people's anxiety about different environmental conditions (e.g., climate change, environmental degradation, pollution) were interconnected, lending support for the existence of eco-anxiety (a broader construct that encompasses climate change anxiety). These results informed further scale development in Study Two. Exploratory (n = 365) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (n = 370) supported a final 13-item scale that captured four dimensions of ecoanxiety: affective symptoms, rumination, behavioural symptoms, and anxiety about one's negative impact on the planet, which were each distinct from stress, anxiety and depression. A further longitudinal sample (n = 189) established the stability of these factors across time. Findings support eco-anxiety as a quantifiable psychological experience, reliably measured using our 13-item eco-anxiety scale, and differentiated from mental health outcomes.","2021-11","2023-09-26 16:12:06","2023-09-26 16:12:06","","","","","71","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000711154700002","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;33<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;33<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;63</p>","","","Climate change; DETERMINANTS; CLIMATE; IMPACTS; Eco-anxiety; Anxiety; DEPRESSION; Climate change anxiety; Eco-anxiety scale; RUMINATION; Wellbeing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We find these imperatives constrained the agency of planners to effectively reconcile climate mitigation/adaptation objectives within wider priorities of economic growth. Yet, we identify instances whereby strategic planning frameworks, informal networks and bespoke development frameworks were effective means to build trust between actors and foster co-operation, better enabling development which meets climate change mitigation/adaptation objectives.

However, there is limited literature on climate change adaptation experiences of African cities, particularly with regard to moving from strategy development to implementation. This continues to hamper efforts to understand and guide city climate change actions on the continent. This article helps address this gap by providing critical insights into the opportunities and challenges experienced, and the solutions found in the process of developing and implementing the Durban Climate Change Strategy (DCCS) in the City of Durban, South Africa. The initial 2015 DCCS was reviewed in 2020/2021, and an analysis of the process and its outcomes provide useful focus areas that could guide other cities across the Global South and beyond for implementing climate change strategies. Based on these focus areas, the article demonstrates that there are considerable governance and other barriers to this process that span multiple scales, but also many opportunities such as good organisation, ongoing support across multiple departments and scales, and perseverance that can be harnessed. The findings have significant practical and policy implications for developing and implementing urban climate strategies and provide important conceptual insights for building transformative resilience in challenging governance contexts.","2022","2023-09-26 16:12:06","2023-09-26 16:12:06","","84-96","","","81","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000930834500008","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;41</p>","","","Climate change adaptation; climate change strategy; local government; Global South; implementation; lessons","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Survey vessels were provided by Norway, the Association of Responsible Krill harvesting companies and Aker BioMarine AS, the United Kingdom, Ukraine, Republic of Korea, and China. Survey design followed the transects of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources synoptic survey, carried out in 2000 and from regular national surveys performed in the South Atlantic sector by the U.S., China, Republic of Korea, Norway, and the U.K. The 2018-19 Area 48 Survey represents only the second large-scale survey performed in the area and this joint effort resulted in the largest ever total transect line (19,500 km) coverage carried out as one single exercise in the Southern Ocean. We delineated and integrated acoustic backscatter arising from krill swarms to produce distribution maps of krill areal biomass density and standing stock (biomass) estimates. Krill standing stock for the Area 48 was estimated to be 62.6 megatonnes (mean density of 30 g m(-)(2) over 2 million km(2)) with a sampling coefficient variation of 13%. The highest mean krill densities were found in the South Orkney Islands stratum (93.2 g m(-2)) and the lowest in the South Georgia Island stratum (6.4 g m(-2)). The krill densities across the strata compared to those found during the previous survey indicate some regional differences in distribution and biomass. It is currently not possible to assign any such differences or lack of differences between the two survey datasets to longer term trends in the environment, krill stocks or fishing pressure.","2021-09","2023-09-26 16:12:06","2023-09-26 16:12:06","","","","3","41","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000739332000014","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;26<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;27<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;101</p>","","","CLIMATE-CHANGE; global climate change; ECOSYSTEM; climate; biomass; BIOMASS; acoustic survey; CCAMLR 2000 SURVEY; DENSITY; ecosystem change; ELEPHANT ISLAND; fishery management; SCALE MANAGEMENT UNITS; SCOTIA SEA; SHETLAND ISLANDS; TARGET-STRENGTH MODEL; zooplankton","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This has been particularly prominent in the realm of environmental sustainability, where smart technologies have been viewed as a way of reducing traffic congestion and delivering energy efficiencies. Key to these aspirations is the way in which technologies are seen to interact with human behaviour and how digital technologies can promote behavioural change through the provision of 'better' information. However, smart city programmes adopt a particular intellectual and pragmatic framing of behavioural change that we argue is fundamentally narrow and unambitious, raising concerns about how behavioural science is mobilised, by whom and its potential to promote sustainable urban futures. First, we propose that the focus in smart city narratives on quantitative data and insights from 'big data' is methodologically narrow and is representative of a highly individualised, libertarian paternalist perspective that privileges rationalistic and atomised understandings of behaviour. Second, we argue that the logic of smart cities leads city governments towards a focus on superficial change and the language of 'encouraging' shifts in individual behaviour that presents a distraction from the urgent need to reconfigure city infrastructures for low carbon forms of living. Third, we explore how such behavioural change approaches are fundamentally didactic and often lapse into assuming that publics are the passive receivers of 'smarter' information rather than active citizens who can question, campaign and present alternative visions to those of corporate-government interests. In this way, we argue that the suffusing of the smart cities and behavioural change agendas act as a neo-liberal distraction to the ways in which cities can develop to support the priorities of human and ecological wellbeing.","2021-10","2023-09-26 16:12:05","2023-09-26 16:12:05","","140-149","","","125","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000680245800015","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;100</p>","","","Climate change; STATE; Behaviour change; CHOICE; CLIMATE-CHANGE POLICY; FREIBURG; GEOGRAPHIES; GERMANY; GOVERNMENT; Mobilities; Smart cities; TRANSPORT","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Variation of climate change across regions and uncertainty about the magnitudes of change call for a diverse mix of adaptations to climate change across different regions and individual farms. This paper considers the institutional structure for effective climate change adaptation by Australian farms. It is argued that a rerun of the history of successful adaptation of farms to new technology, changes in output and input prices, natural climate variation, and other circumstances can be repeated for climate change adaptation. Individual farms can benefit from incentives and rewards to revise their decisions, which will combine with better individual outcomes. Complementary support by the government includes the provision of climate change and weather forecast information, support for research into new technology, help to evaluate the pros and cons of alternative choices, and provision of a social safety net for those unable to adapt.","2021-09","2023-09-26 16:12:05","2023-09-26 16:12:05","","","","9","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000699249600001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;18</p>","","","agriculture; climate change adaptation; farm decision changes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The influence exerted by cognitive situations and climate - driven stress on farmers' decisions to migrate and the socioeconomic attributes of migrating and non-migrating farm families are examined. The emphasis is the function of migration in accessing climate and agricultural extension services as well as the contribution made by migration to promote farmers' climate change coping capacity. Methodology: Survey was articulated using farming households in three agricultural zones of Delta State, Nigeria. Perceptions of farmers about alterations in climate were examined with the use of mental map technique. Binary logistic regression model was applied to assess the function of socioeconomic attributes of farm families while descriptive statistics was employed in evaluating the adaptive capacities of the migrating farming households. Findings: Climate - driven livelihood variables form part of the main propellers of migration among farmers. Migration as well as the socioeconomic attributes is influenced by perception of farmers about climate change. There appears significant difference between migrating and non -migrating farm families with respect to utilization of information, technology and knowledge emanating from agricultural and climate extension services. The gains from remittances, knowledge and social networks from host communities or zones raise migrating farm families capacity to adapt to climate change. Theoretical Implications: This paper contributes to the progressively dynamic body of knowledge by pointing out migration as an alternative climate change adaptation strategy to promote agriculture food security in any part of the world. Originality/Value: Micro - evidence is offered by this study with respect to contribution made by migration to adaptive capacity of farmers and their ability to have access to agricultural and climate extension services. This will be useful in the analysis of climate - driven migration in other nations that are agricultural economies. Insight is also offered regarding policy needs for the scaling down of farmers' vulnerability to climate change.","2022","2023-09-26 16:12:05","2023-09-26 16:12:05","","5-28","","1","116","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000826588500001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;68</p>","","","AFRICA; climate change; INNOVATION; VULNERABILITY; PATTERNS; POLICY; AGRICULTURE; climate change mitigation; LIVELIHOODS; ADAPTIVE CAPACITY; Adaptation strategies; agricultural extension services; climate extension services; internal migration; OPTIONS; REMITTANCES","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But while there is a flourishing literature on institutions' formal rules, processes, and organizational forms, scholars lament a relative lack of attention to institutions' informal side; their cultures. It is important to study institutions' cultures because it is through culture that people relate to institutional norms and rules in taking climate action. This review uncovers what work has been done on institutional cultures and climate change, discerns common themes around which this scholarship coheres, and advances and argument for why institutional cultures matter. We employed a systematic literature review to assemble a set of 54 articles with a shared concern for how climate change and institutional cultures concurrently affect each other. The articles provided evidence of a nascent field, emerging over the past 5-10 years and fragmented across literatures. This field draws on diverse concepts of institutionalism for revealing quite different expressions of culture, and is mostly grounded in empirical studies. These disparate studies compellingly demonstrate, from different perspectives, that institutional cultures do indeed matter for implementing climate governance. Indeed, the articles converge in providing empirical evidence of eight key sites of interaction between climate change and institutional cultures: worldviews, values, logics, gender, risk acceptance, objects, power, and relationality. These eight sites are important foci for examining and effecting changes to institutions and their cultures; showing how institutional cultures shape responses to climate change, and how climate change shapes institutional cultures.

Investigate whether hurricanes result in personal bankruptcy filings due to real property damages. Strengthen existing descriptive results by using fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS). Design/methodology/approach Lagged FMOLS model is used with data from states that suffered hurricane damage between 2000 through 2020. FMOLS controls for various financial distresses that can cause bankruptcy filings. Findings Bankruptcy is usually filed for within one year of a hurricane. Changes in house prices and hurricane severity were significant indicators of bankruptcy filings. However, the divorce rate, commonly thought of as a primary reason for bankruptcy, is insignificant. Research limitations/implications Data was available on a state level for the independent variables. Hurricane damage needed to be financially significant enough for inland flooding to be measurable and influential. Practical implications Establishes that financial distress comes from several sources, not just home damage. Financial distress is highly correlated with whether a home was insured. Divorce does not cause bankruptcy filings. Social implications Federal flood insurance programs should be reexamined.

This could be partly because of limited insight into the contextual underpinnings of its uptake. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to establish the relationship between selected socioeconomic factors and the adoption of CSA in Gilgil Sub-County. This study's results were attained from a binary logistic regression model, using a sample of 120 smallholder potato farmers in two wards of Gilgil Sub-County of Nakuru County, Kenya. An analysis of the five hypothesized explanatory socioeconomic variables contained in the model disclosed that a relationship between socioeconomic factors and adoption of CSAPs was statistically significant at a 5% level of significance (chi(2) = 17.966, df = 5, p < 0.05). It further revealed that only two variables had a significant relationship with the adoption of CSAPs. Among these, included gender which was negative and statistically significant at a 5% level of significance (Wald chi(2) = 6.701, df = 1, p < 0.05) and annual farm income, which was positive and statistically significant at a 5% level of significance (Wald chi(2) = 8.402, df = 1, p < 0.05). Therefore, securing access to vital resources for women farmers is indispensable to enhance their capacity and compliance to adjust production methods in response to climate change.

The Grizzled Skipper, Pyrgus malvae, is a threatened butterfly in long-term decline that has not met expectations of northern expansion in Britain, possibly indicating that climate change has not improved northern habitat suitability or that another driver (e.g. land use change) is masking its effects. Here, we explore the effect of climate on population size trends over four decades, and whether any regions show an improving population trend that may be a precursor to northern expansion. Examining detailed spatio-temporal abundance data can reveal unexpected limitations to population growth that would not be detectable in widely used climate envelope models. Location Central and southern England. Methods Mixed models were used to investigate P. malvae population size in relation to time and monthly climate measures across its UK range since 1976, based on repeated transect walks. Results We found that P. malvae population size declined more over time in the north and west of its UK range than in the south and east, and was negatively related to high December temperature and summer rainfall. However, the effect sizes of temperature and rainfall were minimal. Main Conclusions The last 40 years of climate change have not ameliorated climate suitability for P. malvae at its range edge, contrary to expectations from spatial-only climate envelope models. The clear long-term downward trends in population size are independent of climate change and we propose probably due to habitat deterioration. Our findings highlight potential hazards in predicting species range expansions from spatial models alone. Although some climate variables may be associated with a species' distribution, other factors may be more dominant drivers of trends and therefore more useful predictors of range changes.","2021-06","2023-09-26 16:12:05","2023-09-26 16:12:05","","962-972","","6","27","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000616386200001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;73</p>","","","climate change; TEMPERATURE; TRENDS; BIODIVERSITY; BRITISH BUTTERFLIES; DECLINE; conservation; CONSERVATION; SHIFTS; ABUNDANCE; HABITAT AVAILABILITY; lepidoptera; modelling; range changes; SEMINATURAL GRASSLANDS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although awareness of climate change is growing, few are willing to alter their flight behaviour. Through a qualitative analysis of interview materials collected from Reykjavik Capital Region residents, this study explores how globally affluent, highly mobile young urbanites justify their international travel by plane, despite their climate change awareness, and if they are willing to change their behaviour. Six themes of justifications to continue air travel were identified; shifting responsibility, compensatory behaviours, lack of knowledge or awareness, lack of other options, benefits outweighing impacts, and carbon offsetting. Their use differed depending on respondents' level of climate change awareness and willingness to reduce air travel, but willingness to reduce travel did not differ between awareness level scores. None were willing to quit flying regardless of their level of awareness. Compared with previous literature, we found a greater emphasis placed on the benefits of air travel.

This study's main objective is to demonstrate that the official Spanish climate zones for building do not represent the current climatic conditions and to show how these climate zones will evolve due to the impact of climate change. Given the significant impact that climate change will have on this country, as well as its climatic variety, the proposed methodology can be used as a reference in other regions. Updating of the climate zones of peninsular Spain for 49 cities has been carried out, through the adaptation of these zones to the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios. The results show that two-thirds of these cities are currently designing and constructing buildings with obsolescent climate data that do not take into account the current or future climate reality, which is significantly affecting previous calculations on the thermal performance of buildings.

One of these impacting factors is the climate. In this study, the patterns of OB interactions with heating, cooling, lighting, equipment, windows and shading collected in questionnaire surveys were used as input data in the simulation models of two university buildings. The buildings, a green-rated and a non-rated one, are in Western Sydney University in Sydney, Australia. Then, the models were simulated in eight different climate zones in Australia. Therefore, this research aimed to understand how different climate zones may impact the energy related to OB and compare this impact between a green-rated building and a building without any rating. The results showed that there is no correlation between climate and OB and the levels of discomfort are related to the cooling season. The green building is less subjected to external changes, indicating that in buildings with automatic and properly controlled centralised management systems, the impacts related to the misuse of energy due to OB would be almost irrelevant. The results of this study should not be extended to other occupant behavioural patterns or situations. The results should be confined within the present research and context.","2021-08","2023-09-26 16:12:05","2023-09-26 16:12:05","","174-188","","4","174","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000685500000002","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;55</p>","","","climate change; FRAMEWORK; IMPACT; SIMULATION; CONSUMPTION; environment; energy; BUILDING PERFORMANCE; ENERGY PERFORMANCE; SAVINGS; THERMAL COMFORT","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Venezuela, citrus is the fifth most important fruit crop, with a harvested area of 18,084 ha, and an average yield of 14.2 t ha(-1), below world production. Despite this, there is little information on the physiology and agronomy of the grafting of the most commonly used citrus cultivars in the country, as part of a strategy to select the best combinations (graft/rootstock) and the most limiting seasons for crop production. Objective. To evaluate agronomic and physiological levels of five citrus cultivars during the period 2013-2015. Materials and methods. A trial was carried out on citrus plants sown between the period of January 2013 and August 2015 at the National Center for Agricultural Research, Maracay, Venezuela, in three replications under a completely randomized design, to evaluate variables associated with gas exchange and crop phenology in five cultivars of the most important citrus fruits of Venezuela. Results. 1) Citrus trees showed partial opening of the stomata due to high temperature and drought without causing decrease in photosynthetic rate. 2) The plants with the highest average values in the gas exchange variables in the graft (Cleopatra and Volk) and in the rootstock (Dancy during the driest periods and Valencia in the wettest periods) caused the Cleopatra-Dancy, Cleopatra-Valencia, Volk-Valencia, and Volk-Dancy combinations to achieve the highest photosynthetic yield during all evaluation periods. 3) The budding phenological stage in citrus plants were the most important sink sources for the net photosynthetic assimilation rates. Conclusions. The cultivar Cleopatra-Dancy had the most stable behavior for variables associated with gas exchange and Volk-Dancy for producing in drier seasons.","2022-01","2023-09-26 16:12:04","2023-09-26 16:12:04","","","","1","33","","","","","","","","","","Spanish","","","","WOS:000746133000023","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;26</p>","","","climate change; DROUGHT; WATER; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; CARBOHYDRATE ACCUMULATION; citrus; LEAF; LEAVES; LIMITATIONS; physiology; PLANTS; SINK; STRESSES","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous attribution methods compute the vertically uniform temperature change required to balance the top-of-atmosphere energy imbalance caused by each forcing and feedback, with any departures from vertically uniform warming collected into the lapse-rate feedback. We propose an alternative attribution method using a single-column model that accounts for the forcing dependence of high-latitude lapse-rate changes. We examine this method in an idealized general circulation model (GCM), finding that, even though the column-integrated carbon dioxide (CO2) forcing and water vapor feedback are stronger in the tropics, they contribute to polar-amplified surface warming as they produce bottom-heavy warming in high latitudes. A separation of atmospheric temperature changes into local and remote contributors shows that, in the absence of polar surface forcing (e.g., sea ice retreat), changes in energy transport are primarily responsible for the polar-amplified pattern of warming. The addition of surface forcing substantially increases polar surface warming and reduces the contribution of atmospheric dry static energy transport to the warming. This physically based attribution method can be applied to comprehensive GCMs to provide a clearer view of the mechanisms behind Arctic amplification.","2021-03","2023-09-26 16:12:04","2023-09-26 16:12:04","","2355-2365","","6","34","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000646372800022","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;21<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;21<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;40</p>","","","Climate change; FRAMEWORK; CLIMATE; ATMOSPHERE; ARCTIC AMPLIFICATION; PART I; Arctic; Feedback; CIRCULATION RESPONSE; CO2; TEMPERATURE FEEDBACKS; THERMAL-EQUILIBRIUM","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Empirical evidence exists regarding the adverse health effects of climate change and mass incarceration, which occur in cascading and overlapping categories and include preventable death, illness, and injury. Researchers underscore the medical vulnerability of incarcerated populations, who are increasingly susceptible to climate-driven exposure pathways and mental and physical health outcomes involving extreme temperatures, natural disasters, infectious diseases, and displacement.

Quantifying the impact of these precipitation changes on flood damages is necessary to estimate the costs of climate change. However, there is little empirical evidence linking changes in precipitation to the historically observed increase in flood losses. We use >6,600 reports of state-level flood damage to quantify the historical relationship between precipitation and flood damages in the United States. Our results show a significant, positive effect of both monthly and 5-d state-level precipitation on state-level flood damages. In addition, we find that historical precipitation changes have contributed approximately one-third of cumulative flood damages over 1988 to 2017 (primary estimate 36%; 95% CI 20 to 46%), with the cumulative impact of precipitation change totaling $73 billion (95% CI 39 to $91 billion). Further, climate models show that anthropogenic climate forcing has increased the probability of exceeding precipitation thresholds at the extremely wet quantiles that are responsible for most flood damages. Climate models project continued intensification of wet conditions over the next three decades, although a trajectory consistent with UN Paris Agreement goals significantly curbs that intensification. Taken together, our results quantify the contribution of precipitation trends to recent increases in flood damages, advance estimates of the costs associated with historical greenhouse gas emissions, and provide further evidence that lower levels of future warming are very likely to reduce financial losses relative to the current global warming trajectory.","2021-01-26","2023-09-26 16:12:04","2023-09-26 16:12:04","","","","4","118","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000612945500045","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;67<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;67<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;48</p>","","","climate change; TRENDS; CLIMATE; ATTRIBUTION; WEATHER; HYDROLOGICAL CYCLE; precipitation; UNITED-STATES; INTENSE PRECIPITATION; EXTREME-PRECIPITATION; flooding; LOSSES","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent-past and near-future climate conditions are compared. The past climate period is from November 1981 to October 2011. The future climate applies to a 30-yr period centered on 2050. A pseudo-global warming approach is used, with the driver reanalysis dataset perturbed by the CMIP5 ensemble mean model guidance. Using the 30-yr retrospective simulation, a vertical adjustment technique is used to determine meteorological parameters in the complex terrain where ski areas are located. For snow water equivalent (SWE), Snowpack Telemetry sites close to ski areas are used to validate the technique and apply a correction to SWE in ski areas. The vulnerability to climate change is assessed for 71 ski areas in the IWUS considering SWE, artificially produced snow, temperature, and rain; 20 of the ski areas will tend to have fewer than 100 days per season with sufficient natural and artificial snow for skiing. These ski areas are located at either low elevations or low latitudes, making these areas the most vulnerable to climate change. Throughout the snow season, natural SWE decreases significantly at the low elevations and low latitudes. At higher elevations, changes in SWE are predicted to not be significant in the midseason. In mid-February, SWE decreases by 11.8% at the top elevations of ski areas and decreases by 25.8% at the base elevations.","2021-05","2023-09-26 16:12:04","2023-09-26 16:12:04","","677-694","","5","60","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000660818400004","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;62</p>","","","ADAPTATION; Climate change; MODEL; PRECIPITATION; Adaptation; VULNERABILITY; WATER; ONTARIO; SNOWMAKING; CANADA; RESORTS; Snowpack","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, statistical downscaling using established machine learning techniques is compared with the proposed extreme gradient boosting decision tree (EXGBDT) technique. The Cauvery river basin in southern peninsular India, which is known for its frequent droughts and floods, was considered in this study. The ACCESS 1.0 CMIP5 historical GCM simulation was used for downscaling the local climate with the help of daily observation data from 35 stations located in the study zone. An intercomparison of model performance in predicting daily weather variables such as precipitation and average, maximum, and minimum temperatures over the upper, middle, and lower Cauvery river basin was performed. The findings show that mean-variance is around 15 % and bias is negligible for the proposed EXGBDT model, which is better than other models under consideration.

This study investigated the changes of Koppen climate type over China during 1964 - 2015. On average, the arid climate was located in the north-west, tropical climate, temperate climate, and cold climate were distributed in the east from south to north along the latitude, and polar climate was concentrated on the Tibetan Plateau. Comparing Koppen climate types during 1964 - 1989 and 1990 - 2015, we found that cold climate with dry winter was replaced by a cold steppe climate in Northeast China and North China, warm summer was replaced by cold summer in Northeast China and the Tibetan Plateau, tundra climate was substituted by cold climate in the Tibetan Plateau, and cold climate was replaced by temperate climate in Central China and East China. Our results showed that the arid climate expanded eastward and southward, which may have resulted from a decrease in pre-cipitation. Owing to the increase in temperature, the climate zones moved northward. This study provides valuable insights for government decision-makers in formulating crop planting systems, water resource management, and land use planning.","2021-08","2023-09-26 16:12:03","2023-09-26 16:12:03","","483-496","","4","32","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000756940300004","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;55</p>","","","DROUGHT; Climate change; EXTREMES; PRECIPITATION; IMPACT; China; SURFACE-TEMPERATURE; TREND; WORLD MAP; Annual climate type; Koppen; PROJECTED CHANGES; SOLAR-RADIATION; ZONES","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The use of higher resolution regional climate models (RCMs) to downscale global climate model simulations is of high importance. In the present study, future climate change over TP and the surrounding areas is investigated based on the ensemble of a set of the 21st century climate change projections using the RCM RegCM4. The model is driven by five different GCMs at a grid spacing of 25 km under RCP4.5. The focus is on the December-January-February (DJF), June-July-August (JJA), and annual mean temperature and precipitation, with comparisons against the driving GCMs also provided. Overall, the RegCM4 greatly improves the simulation by providing finer scale spatial details of both temperature and precipitation distributions over the region. The topographic effects are well reproduced by RegCM4 but not the GCMs. For the projected future changes, general warming and increase in precipitation are found in both GCM and RegCM4 simulations. However, substantial differences exist in both the spatial distribution and magnitude of the changes. The added value of RegCM4 for temperature, in addition to the finer spatial details, is characterized by a more pronounced warming in DJF over TP compared to its surrounding areas. The projected changes of precipitation show also differences between RegCM4 and the driving GCMs. The increase of precipitation is more pronounced and over the basins in DJF for RegCM4, and in general with a better agreement across the simulations compared to the driving GCMs.","2021-06","2023-09-26 16:12:03","2023-09-26 16:12:03","","313-321","","3","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000675859500003","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;18<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;20<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;59</p>","","","TEMPERATURE; Climate change; MODEL; EXTREMES; PRECIPITATION; CMIP5; CHINA; Regional climate model; DATASET; EARTH-SYSTEM; REGCM4; Tibetan plateau","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We analyze how the risk of extreme soil moisture droughts in SWNA, analogous to the most severe 21-year (>= in magnitude to 2000-2020) and single-year (>= in magnitude to 2002) events of the last several decades, changes in projections from Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. By the end of the 21(st) century, SWNA experiences robust (R >= 0.80) soil moisture drying and substantial increases in extreme single-year drought risk that scale strongly with warming, spanning an 8%-26% probability of occurrence across +2-4 K. Notably, our results show that 21-year droughts analogous to 2000-2020 are up to 5 times more likely than extreme single-year droughts under all levels of warming (approximate to 50%). These high levels of 21-year drought risk are largely invariant across scenarios because of large spring precipitation declines in half the models, shifting SWNA into a drier mean state. Despite projections of this sweeping and ostensibly inevitable increase in 21-year drought risk, climate mitigation reduces their severity by reducing the magnitude of extreme single-year droughts during these events. Our results emphasize both the importance of preparing SWNA for imminent increases in persistent drought events and constraining projected precipitation uncertainty to better resolve future long-term drought risk.","2021-09","2023-09-26 16:12:03","2023-09-26 16:12:03","","","","9","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000702283700004","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;14<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;14<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;102</p>","","","climate change; CMIP6; RUNOFF; SNOW; drought; UNITED-STATES; CALIFORNIA; COLORADO; PLANT-RESPONSES; TREE MORTALITY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, this carpooling initiative faces some limitations due to the difficulties in managing the sharing of cars during the week, and in making the occupation of parking spaces as effective as possible; such intricacies can contribute to the increase of air pollution and fuel expenditures. Considering that, this work presents an analysis of the feasibility of a carpool application (app) focused on the drivers' commuting routine and, at the same time, capable of proposing an optimized car- sharing system. To achieve the desired goal, we adopted an interdisciplinary approach in the scope of the software development methodology called Double Diamond, which made it possible to verify that 53.4% of the civil servants travel alone to the campus most the week, and 84.4% of them would use the carpool app. Based on these findings, we built a set of primary requirements for the application and specified a user's journey, in the form of a wireframe of its initial prototype by using the Figma design tool.","2021","2023-09-26 16:12:03","2023-09-26 16:12:03","","","","6","37","","","","","","","","","","Portuguese","","","","WOS:000729745900001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;17</p>","","","Application; Carpooling; Climate changes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Elevated density altitude (DA) reduces aircraft and engine performance and has a direct impact on operational capabilities. The frequency of higher DA will increase with the combination of higher air temperatures and higher dewpoint temperatures. The inclusion of dewpoint temperature in DA projections will become increasingly critical as minimum air temperatures rise. High DA impacts aircraft performance in the following ways: reduction in power because the engine takes in less air; reduction in thrust because a propeller is less efficient in less dense air; reduction in lift because less dense air exerts less force on the airfoils. For fixed-wing aircraft, the performance impacts include decreased maximum takeoff weight and increased true airspeed, which results in longer takeoff and landing distance. For rotary-wing aircraft, the performance impacts include reduced power margin, reduced maximum gross weight, reduced hover ceiling, and reduced rate of climb. In this research, downscaled and bias-corrected maximum and minimum air temperatures for future time periods are collected and analyzed for a selected site: Little Rock Air Force Base, Arkansas. Impacts corresponding to DA thresholds are identified and integrated into risk probability matrices enabling quantifiable comparisons. As the magnitude and frequency of high DA occurrences are projected to increase as a result of climate change, it is imperative for military mission planners and acquisition officers to comprehend and utilize these projections in their decision-making processes.","2021-01","2023-09-26 16:12:03","2023-09-26 16:12:03","","39-55","","1","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000665787800004","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;43</p>","","","Climate change; IMPACTS; Aircraft observations; TEMPERATURES","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, whether they play roles in the formation of SSTAs remains unclear. In this study, we find that the surface net heat flux anomalies in different El Nino types have different effects on the development of the spatial pattern of SSTAs. By applying the fuzzy clustering method, El Nino events during 1982-2018 are classified into two types: 1) extreme El Milos with strong positive SSTAs, with the largest SSTAs in the eastern equatorial Pacific, and 2) moderate El Ninos with moderate positive SSTAs, with the largest SSTAs in the central equatorial Pacific. The surface net heat flux anomalies in extreme El Ninos generally display a ""larger warming gets more damping"" zonal paradigm, and essentially do not impact the formation of the spatial pattern of SSTAs. Those in moderate El Ninos, however, can impact the formation of the spatial pattern of SSTAs by producing more damping effects in the eastern than in the central equatorial Pacific, thus favoring the largest SSTAs being confined to the central equatorial Pacific. More damping effects of net heat flux anomalies in the eastern equatorial Pacific in moderate El Ninos are contributed by the surface latent heat flux anomalies, which are mainly regulated by the negative relative humidity-SST feedback and the positive wind-evaporation-SST feedback. Therefore, we highlight that these two atmospheric adjustments should be considered during the development of moderate El Ninos in order to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the formation of El Nino diversity.","2021-07","2023-09-26 16:12:02","2023-09-26 16:12:02","","5229-5242","","13","34","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000775651000005","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;53</p>","","","Climate change; IMPACTS; OCEAN; TELECONNECTIONS; Climate variability; EVENTS; ENSO; EASTERN-PACIFIC; El Nino; EQUATORIAL PACIFIC; ITCZ; NINO; WARM","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The model is based on an already comprehensive and intuitive one developed by Besley and Dixit, which has been modified by including a backstop technology (e.g., a renewable energy technology). This improved formulation allows for a more realistic representation of the climate change problem in that it is able to include the decoupling of economic growth and GHG emissions. The model allows us to understand the implications of different assumptions, such as the rate of growth of the economy, or the damages expected from climate change, on the willingness to pay against it. Our results show that, for a baseline scenario, the willingness to pay (WTP) is 0.52% of annual GDP, lower than that obtained by Besley and Dixit, which shows the significant benefits of developing competitive mitigation technologies.

Of particular concern are the co-occurrence of lake heatwaves (anomalously warm temperatures) and high chlorophyll-a extremes, two important variables that influence the functioning of aquatic ecosystems. Here, using satellite observations, we provide the first assessment of univariate and compound extreme events in lakes worldwide. Our analysis suggests that the intensity of lake heatwaves and high chlorophyll-a extremes differ across lakes and are influenced primarily by the annual range in surface water temperature and chlorophyll-a concentrations. The intensity of lake heatwaves is even greater in smaller lakes and in those that are shallow and experience cooler average temperatures. Our analysis also suggests that, in most of the studied lakes, compound extremes occur more often than would be assumed from the product of their independent probabilities. We anticipate compound extreme events to have more severe impacts on lake ecosystems than those previously reported due to the occurrence of univariate extremes.","2021-12","2023-09-26 16:12:02","2023-09-26 16:12:02","","","","12","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000730944600001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;9<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;9<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;67</p>","","","climate change; SCALE; IMPACT; RESPONSES; HEATWAVES; NORTHERN-HEMISPHERE; BLOOMS; CLIMATE EXTREMES; extremes; FISH; FLUCTUATION; limnology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is because historical observations do not encompass variations large enough to provoke such regime changes, and paleoclimate conditions are rarely used to help develop and tune ESMs, which potentially ignores a rich source of information on abrupt climate change. A critical example is the early to mid-Holocene ""greening"" and subsequent rapid desertification of the Sahara, which most ESMs fail to reproduce, casting doubt on the representation of land-atmosphere coupling and monsoon dynamics. Here, we show that this greening and abrupt termination can be successfully simulated with one ESM after optimizing uncertain model components using both present-day observations and crucially mid-Holocene (6,000 y before present) reconstructions. The optimized model displays abrupt threshold behavior, which shows excellent agreement with long paleoclimate records that were not used in the original optimization. These results suggest that in order to realistically capture climate-system thresholds, ESMs first need to be conditioned with appropriate paleoclimate information.","2021-11-09","2023-09-26 16:12:02","2023-09-26 16:12:02","","","","45","118","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000720928400014","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;13<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;13<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;65</p>","","","SIMULATIONS; VEGETATION; SYSTEM; climate model; ABRUPT CHANGE; abrupt climate change; CLIMATE-MODEL; COUPLED MODEL; HUMID PERIOD; MIDHOLOCENE; SAHARA; TERMINATION; tipping point","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fast environmental change influencing the polar areas will likewise have significant physical and biological outcomes for the remaining part of the planet since the ice-covered Arctic Ocean, the Antarctic landmass, and the globally notable Antarctic Circumpolar Current serves a critical job in controlling the Earth's environment and sea frameworks. This study concentrates on the contributing variables of environmental change, the impacts of environmental change on the Arctic biome, alongside the impacts of environmental change on the species of the Arctic biome. The outcomes are evident that biodiversity is being affected extremely by environmental change through its degradation of natural surroundings and adverse consequences on species inside.","2022","2023-09-26 16:12:02","2023-09-26 16:12:02","","35-39","","2","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000810787400005","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;19</p>","","","Climate change; POPULATIONS; Biodiversity; Arctic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it is unclear if the diversified climate systems, in combination with the complex terrain and varying vegetation types, would result in contrasting patterns of changes in climate across the region. Based on the CRU TS data for the period 1901-2017, we examined the spatiotemporal characteristics of the regional climate, and identified types of climate change patterns and drivers. Overall, the region experienced significant increases in annual mean temperature during 1901-2017, with occurrence of a significant turning point in 1954 for a more pronounced warming (0.16 degrees C/10 a). The annual precipitation fluctuated greatly over the study period without apparent trend, albeit the occurrence of a significant turning point in 1928 for a slight increase in the later period (1.19 mm/10 a). Spatially the multi-year averages of selective climate variables during 1901-2017 displayed a trend of decreases from southeast to northwest, but with increasing variability. We identified five major climate change types across the study region, including warmer (T+), drier (P-), warmer-drier (T+P-), warmer-wetter (T+P+), and no significant changes (NSC). The type T+P+ mainly occurred in the western parts over the plateau sub-frigid semiarid ecozone (77.0%) and the plateau sub-frigid semihumid ecozone (19.9%). The central parts of the region are characterized by the type T+, corresponding to six ecozones, including the mid-subtropical humid ecozone (33.1%), the plateau temperate humid-semihumid ecozone (28.8%), the plateau sub-rigid semihumid ecozone (9.5%), the southern subtropical humid ecozone (8.1%), the plateau sub-frigid arid ecozone (7.3%), and the plateau temperate semiarid ecozone (6.6%). No significant change in climate was detected for the eastern parts over the mid-subtropical humid ecozone (67.3%), the plateau temperate humid and semihumid ecozone (19.5%) and the plateau sub-frigid semihumid ecozone (8.8%). The types P- and T+P- together accounted for less than 5% of the entire study region, which predominantly occurred in central Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau and south of the southeastern Xizang, corresponding predominantly to the mid-subtropical humid ecozone. Across the region and within the zonal climate change types, vegetation and topography both played a significant role in determining the climate variability and magnitude of changes. Our results suggest that the southwestern China experienced intensified influences of the southeasterly monsoon and the southerly monsoon in the regional climate, while the westerly alpine influences subsided; topography and vegetation affected the magnitudes of the directional changes in climate at a local scale.","2022-06","2023-09-26 16:12:02","2023-09-26 16:12:02","","755-765","","3","33","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000678016200001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;52</p>","","","TEMPERATURE; Climate change; PRECIPITATION; TIBETAN PLATEAU; FEEDBACKS; FORESTS; Ecozone; Regional climate; Topography; Vegetation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Spatiotemporal changes in climate extremes and return values are investigated compared to 1981-2010. Climate model-related uncertainties are quantified using 14 models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) and 8 models from phase 6 (CMIP6). CMIP6 models have a higher sensitivity to external forcings as the CMIP6 ensemble suggests an increase in maximum and minimum temperatures by 1.45 degrees C (0.8-1.9 degrees C) and 1.54 degrees C (1.1-1.9 degrees C) under the high emission scenario, which is greater than by CMIP5 ensemble: 1.10 degrees C (0.5-1.7 degrees C) and 1.13 degrees C (0.7-1.6 degrees C), respectively. No significant changes in annual rainfall are projected, although it will be temporally more uneven with decreases (6-11%) during the pre-rainy season (March-May) and increases (2-8%) during the rainy season (June-October). The bootstrap analysis technique shows the inter-model uncertainties for rainfall projections in CMIP6 have reduced by 40% compared to CMIP5. The annual number of hot days will increase more than twofold and warm nights, more than threefold. Near-future will experience an increase in the rainfall intensity, a decrease in the number of rainy days, and an increase in the 20-year return values of annual maximum 1-day rainfall and consecutive 5-days rainfall (>30%). In addition, the rainy season will be shortened in the future as onset and retreat are delayed, which may have implications in agricultural activities in the basin since cultivation is primarily rainfed. These findings suggest that anthropogenic activities will significantly amplify the climate extremes. The study results will be useful for managing climate-related risks and developing adaptation measures to improve resilience towards potential climate hazards.","2022-03-30","2023-09-26 16:12:02","2023-09-26 16:12:02","","2470-2492","","4","42","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000695692800001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;7<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;7<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;78</p>","","","climate change; RAINFALL; TEMPERATURE; VARIABILITY; RIVER-BASIN; EUROPE; PRECIPITATION; BIAS CORRECTION; climate extremes; CHANGE IMPACT; MONSOON; Thailand; HighResMIP; PROBABILITY; uncertainties","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most nations' emissions-reduction policies and actions do not seem to reflect this long-term threat, as collectively they point toward widespread permanent inundation of many developed areas. Using state-of-the-art new global elevation and population data, we show here that, under high emissions scenarios leading to 4 C-circle warming and a median projected 8.9 m of global mean sea level rise within a roughly 200- to 2000-year envelope, at least 50 major cities, mostly in Asia, would need to defend against globally unprecedented levels of exposure, if feasible, or face partial to near-total extant area losses. Nationally, China, India, Indonesia, and Vietnam, global leaders in recent coal plant construction, have the largest contemporary populations occupying land below projected high tide lines, alongside Bangladesh. We employ this population-based metric as a rough index for the potential exposure of the largely immovable built environment embodying cultures and economies as they exist today. Based on median sea level projections, at least one large nation on every continent but Australia and Antarctica would face exceptionally high exposure: land home to at least one-tenth and up to two-thirds of current population falling below tideline. Many small island nations are threatened with near-total loss. The high tide line could encroach above land occupied by as much as 15% of the current global population (about one billion people). By contrast, meeting the most ambitious goals of the Paris Climate Agreement will likely reduce exposure by roughly half and may avoid globally unprecedented defense requirements for any coastal megacity exceeding a contemporary population of 10 million.","2021-11","2023-09-26 16:12:02","2023-09-26 16:12:02","","","","11","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000709981300001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;13<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;13<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;82</p>","","","ADAPTATION; climate change; PROJECTIONS; CLIMATE; EMISSIONS; FUTURE; SCENARIOS; climate impacts; ICE-SHEET; AGREEMENT; COMMITMENT; LAND; sea level rise","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The researchers used a survey questionnaire as the primary tool for gathering data. Mean and percentage were used to describe the profile of the respondents and their awareness of climate change while Chi-Square Test was used to determine the significant difference in the awareness of the respondents in terms of their profile. The results showed that the students demonstrated a moderate level of awareness of the occurrences, causes and consequences of climate change. When compared against their personal backgrounds, the result revealed that there is no significant difference in their level of climate change awareness. This moderate level of awareness towards climate change, despite the harsh weather conditions frequently experienced in Batanes, calls for intensifying the school's efforts in raising awareness of the occurrence, consequences, and causes of climate change. Consequently, these actions will eventually improve the attitude and behaviour of the students to take active participation in the protection of the environment.","2022","2023-09-26 16:12:02","2023-09-26 16:12:02","","41-49","","3","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000849737700006","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;28</p>","","","Climate change; Awareness; Climate literacy; Curriculum; Integration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The sustainability of coffee production at the global and regional scale is under threat by climate change, with a major risk of losing near to 50% of today's suitable area for coffee by 2050. Rain-fed coffee production dominates in the region, and under increasing climate variability and climate change impacts, these production areas are under threat due to air temperature increase and changes in rainfall patterns and volumes. Identification, evaluation, and implementation of adaptation strategies for growers to cope with climate variability and change impacts are relevant and high priority. Incremental adaptation strategies, including proper soil and water management, contribute to improved water use efficiency (WUE) and should be the first line of action to adapt the coffee crop to the changing growing conditions. This research's objective was to evaluate at field level over five years the influence of fertilization with calcium (Ca+2) and potassium (K+) on WUE in two coffee arabica varieties: cv. Castillo and cv. Caturra. Castillo has resistance against coffee leaf rust (CLR) (Hemileia vastatrix Verkeley and Brome), while Caturra is not CLR-resistant. WUE was influenced by yield changes during the years by climate variability due to El Nino-ENSO conditions and CLR incidence. Application of Ca+2 and K+ improved the WUE under such variable conditions. The highest WUE values were obtained with an application of 100 kg CaO ha(-1) year(-1) and between 180 to 230 kg K2O ha(-1) year(-1). The results indicate that adequate nutrition with Ca+2 and K+ can improve WUE in the long-term, even underwater deficit conditions and after the substantial incidence. Hence, an optimum application of Ca+2 and K+ in rain-fed coffee plantations can be regarded as an effective strategy to adapt to climate variability and climate change.","2021-06","2023-09-26 16:12:02","2023-09-26 16:12:02","","","","2","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000665128300001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;49</p>","","","climate change; climate variability; YIELD; ARABICA; calcium; potassium; WUE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Climatic measurements from meteorological stations of the regions were acquired for the period from 1988 to 2018. We compared the people's perception with trends and variabilities of observed temperature and rainfall patterns. The results showed that, over the last three decades, temperature and precipitation trends and variability between regions varied, largely corroborating the local experiences. The temperature increased in mountain, midhills, and lowland by 0.061 degrees, 0.063 degrees, and 0.017 degrees C yr(-1), respectively. In contrast, rainfall decreased by -9.7, -3.6, and -0.04 mm yr(-1) for the regions, respectively. Although the amount of rainfall decrease observed in the mountain was highest, its variability was found to be relatively low, and vice versa in lowland. Approximately 88% of interviewees perceived temperature rise, and 74% noticed rainfall decline. Local residents linked these changes with their livelihood activities, as exemplified by, for example, crop's quality and quantity and birds' migration. The results indicate that local understandings complement the scarce observational data and provide a reliable and additional foundation to determine changes in climatic variables. Moreover, the result infers that small changes in climate variables have noticeable implications on human behavior change. Therefore, besides active participation of local communities, integrating local understanding is crucial in developing climate change-related policies and strategies at local and national levels.","2022-01","2023-09-26 16:12:01","2023-09-26 16:12:01","","205-222","","1","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000798742900014","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;116</p>","","","RAINFALL; TEMPERATURE; RIVER-BASIN; Climate change; CHANGE IMPACTS; Temperature; Precipitation; Climate variability; FARMERS PERCEPTIONS; PRECIPITATION TRENDS; Trends; ADAPTATION STRATEGIES; LAND-SURFACE; SEASONAL VARIABILITY; VALLEY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper explores how these funds help to mainstream climate change and examines the barriers they encounter in the process. The analytical framework uses a process-based understanding of policy integration to examine how financial incentives are able to support climate mainstreaming. Methodologically, this paper examines the experience of the Bangladesh Climate Change Resilience Fund and Ethiopia's Climate Resilient Green Economy Facility. Policymakers, officials related to the funds, and other stakeholders were interviewed. This paper finds that national climate funds sought to achieve mainstreaming by engaging with sectoral ministries. Such engagement was expected to lead to changes in sectoral and system-wide policy goals and instruments. The three main approaches for sectoral engagement were: serving as implementing entities, participating in fund governance, and via in-house climate change units. The findings underscore how finance received by the funds shapes programming, how the lack of detailed plans limit the ability of policies to pull in the finance desired, and the inconsistent role played by climate change units. A disaggregated approach to climate mainstreaming allows us to identify where and how financial incentives can be useful.","2022-04-21","2023-09-26 16:12:01","2023-09-26 16:12:01","","311-320","","4","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000656058100001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;7<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;7<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;24</p>","","","ADAPTATION; Climate change; POLICY; climate finance; policy integration; BLACK-BOX; climate mainstreaming; INTEGRATION; national climate funds","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Winter season severity varies both spatially and temporally in the Midwest, and past studies have documented significant changes in Midwest winter characteristics, including increases in temperature and decreases in snow depth. In this study, we use the Accumulated Winter Season Severity Index (AWSSI) to characterize winter severity across the Midwest and assess its variability and change on various spatial and temporal scales during the 1951-2020 period. AWSSI is derived from daily records of snowfall (SF), snow depth (SD), maximum surface air temperature (TMAX), and minimum surface air temperature (TMIN) during the winter season. The daily total AWSSI index value reflects the sum of points accumulated from daily values of each of these four variables surpassing pre-determined thresholds, and the total season sum reflects the overall winter season severity. We find AWSSI provides a unique perspective by which to describe climatological differences in winter season character in the Midwest. Namely, over three quarters of winter season days accumulate points in the northern Midwest, compared to just over half in the southern Midwest. Meanwhile, the relative contribution of extreme winter days to total winter severity is much larger in the southern Midwest than farther north. In addition, we find overall winter season severity has significantly decreased at only a quarter of stations and the frequency of extreme winter days has significantly decreased at only a fifth of stations, despite widespread increases in winter daily maximum and minimum temperature. The results suggest Midwest U.S. winter season severity as described by the AWSSI has not significantly changed over the past 70 years.","2022-05","2023-09-26 16:12:24","2023-09-26 16:12:24","","3537-3552","","6","42","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000716092600001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;53</p>","","","climate change; IMPACT; PROJECTIONS; COVER; INDEX; STORMS; HOMOGENIZATION; GREAT-LAKES; 20TH-CENTURY; LAKE-EFFECT SNOWFALL; Midwest; SNOWSTORMS; winter severity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The largest CO2 cooling effects in the thermosphere are predicted for solar minimum conditions. A comparison of solar minima in 1954/1964 to the recent one in 2019 was used to check at the quantitative level the theoretical predictions and the validity of the CO2 cooling hypothesis. June monthly median noontime ionospheric observations at Moscow, Rome, and Slough/Chilton were used to infer neutral gas density rho, exospheric temperature T-ex, height of the F-2-layer maximum h(m)F(2), and total solar EUV flux for the (1954-2020) period. Solar and geomagnetic activity was shown to explain similar to 99 % of the whole variability in the retrieved neutral gas density and T-ex during the (1958-2020) period resulting in statistically insignificant residual linear trends. A comparison of 1954/1964 to 2019 solar minima does not confirm the theoretically predicted decrease of similar to 21 % in rho, similar to 15 K in T-ex, and similar to 7 km in h(m)F(2) related to a 29 % increase of the CO2 abundance.

Using a panel of firm-level data from Chile we find support to this hypothesis.

Climate models project altered seasonal precipitation patterns, and thus, the effects of climate change on available resources and pollination services will depend on the season. Plants have evolved reproductive strategies to so they are not limited by either pollen or water availability in their reproductive success, and therefore, we expect that the disruption of climate change might cause plants to be more pollen limited in seasons that become wetter than they were historically. In this study, we conducted a pollen supplementation experiment within the Global Change Experiment Facility (GCEF) in Central Germany. The GCEF experimentally manipulates future climate based on a realistic scenario of climate change for the region (drier summers and wetter springs and falls) in a native grassland ecosystem. We quantified seed production of two perennial species Dianthus carthusianorum and Scabiosa ochroleuca in response to pollination treatments (control, supplement), climate treatments (ambient and future) and season (summer and fall). Dianthus carthusianorum produced more seeds in future climate conditions independent of the season, but only when given supplemental pollen. Both species showed an increased reproduction in summer compared with the fall. We did not find evidence for our specific expectation of higher pollen limitation in the future climate and fall season (i.e., no three-way interaction pollination x season x climate), which might be explained by the high-drought tolerance and generalized pollination of our focal plant species. We conclude that plant reproductive success has the potential to change with changing climates and that this change will depend on how pollinator services change in the future. We offer many suggestions for future studies that are necessary to understand the context dependence and underlying mechanisms of plant reproductive responses to climate.","2022-01","2023-09-26 16:12:24","2023-09-26 16:12:24","","","","1","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000747845400077","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;56</p>","","","climate change; TEMPERATURE; PRECIPITATION; PATTERNS; GROWTH; GERMANY; FLOWERING PLANTS; LIMITATION; LIMITS; pollen supplementation; pollination; POLLINATORS; RESOURCE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since 2009, the climate movement has sought to keep coal, the principle contributor to global heating, in the ground, confronting the entrenched power of the coal-industrial complex at the places where it is extracted. This article analyzes data from extended ethnographic research at two such sites, on the Liverpool Plains in Australia and the Lausitz (Lusatia) in Eastern Germany. In both locations, farmers, villagers, citizens' initiatives, Indigenous groups, and climate activists engaged in a process of ""strategic communing"" in a shared struggle to protect their homes, fields, and forests from coal mining. I focus on the shared narratives which emerged from this process and analyze them applying Smith and Howe's concept of climate change as ""social drama."" This analysis reveals how small-scale struggles against coal mining, and the scripts or storylines employed by different actors, can make the sites of struggle morally meaningful in the drama of climate change. Such struggles, I argue, are themselves an important theater in which the global risk of climate change is staged. They foster solidarity between different actors and allow the emergence of exemplary narratives, ""shared storylines"" of resistance to the fossil-fuel economy and agitation for climate action.","2021-05-19","2023-09-26 16:12:24","2023-09-26 16:12:24","","465-481","","4","15","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000611630700001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;67</p>","","","Climate change; climate movement; climate communication; protest; coal; place; social drama","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We illustrate the utility of 'situated adaptation' by filling an empirical gap relating to experiences of political-economic and environmental change in Sri Lanka's Dry Zone. We detail situated experiences by drawing on field research in the Anuradhapura District, revealing how the lives and livelihoods of farmer participants are structured by a productivity-vulnerability paradox. We demonstrate how a prevalent adaptation-development paradigm (whereby development and adaptation programs co-exist in theory and practice) is unable to address the structural drivers of vulnerability in Sri Lanka's Dry Zone.

This study aimed at investigating the factors that determine adaptation choices using multivariate and ordered econometric models. It also examined the complementarity and substitutability of adaptation strategies using primary data collected from 383 smallholder farmers in North-Western Ethiopia. Our findings revealed adoption complimentary but no evidence of substitutability among adaptation strategies. The multivariate probit model estimation showed that household heads education level, gender, farmland soil fertility, access to extension service, credit access, climate information and key assets ownership are the key determinants of adoptions. The likelihood of adoption decreased when average long-term rainfall increased. In terms of the interaction effect between gender and access to credit, the study found that women-headed households with access to credit were more likely to use a higher number of adaptation strategies relative to women-headed households without access to credit. The significant factors for each strategy were different that entails how important it is to consider their unique characteristics in policy design and interventions.

Annual terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP) was taken as the representative ecological indicator of the ecosystem. Under 1.5 degrees C global warming, GPP in four climate zones-i.e., temperate continental; temperate monsoonal; subtropical-tropical monsoonal; high-cold Tibetan Plateau-showed a marked increase, the smallest magnitude of which was around 12.3%. The increase was greater under 2 degrees C of global warming, which suggests that from the perspective of ecosystem productivity, global warming poses no ecological risk in China. Specifically, in comparison with historical GPP (1986-2005), under 1.5 degrees C global warming GPP was projected to increase by 16.1-23.8% in the temperate continental zone, 12.3-16.1% in the temperate monsoonal zone, 12.5-14.7% in the subtropical-tropical monsoonal zone, and 20.0-37.0% on the Tibetan Plateau. Under 2 degrees C global warming, the projected GPP increase was 23.0-34.3% in the temperate continental zone, 21.2-24.4% in the temperate monsoonal zone, 16.1-28.4% in the subtropical-tropical monsoonal zone, and 28.4-63.0% on the Tibetan Plateau. The GPP increase contributed by climate change was further quantified and attributed. The ESM prediction from the Max Planck Institute suggested that the climate contribution could range from -12.8% in the temperate continental zone up to 61.1% on the Tibetan Plateau; however, the ESMs differed markedly regarding their climate contribution to GPP change. Although precipitation has a higher sensitivity coefficient, temperature generally plays a more important role in GPP change, primarily because of the larger relative change in temperature in comparison with that of precipitation.","2021-11","2023-09-26 16:12:23","2023-09-26 16:12:23","","","","21","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000718582500001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;37</p>","","","climate change; TEMPERATURE; VARIABILITY; CMIP6; PRECIPITATION; RESPONSES; CLIMATE; CMIP5; REGION; PATTERNS; COVARIATION; ESM; GPP; REANALYSES","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At the national level, increasing the effective diversity of cultivated crops has been found to increase temporal production stability, i.e., the year-to-year stability of total caloric production of all crops combined. Here, we specifically investigated these effects at the regional level for the European Union and tested the effect of crop diversity in relation to agricultural inputs, soil properties, climate instability, and time on caloric, protein, and fat stability, as we hypothesized that the effect of diversity is context dependent. We further investigated these relationships for specific countries. We found that greater crop diversity was consistently associated with an increase in production stability, particularly in regions with large areas equipped for irrigation and low soil type diversity. For instance, in Spain and Italy, crop diversity showed the strongest positive effect among all predictors, while on the European level, the stabilizing effect of nitrogen use was substantially higher. In Germany, the crop diversity-stability relationship was weak, suggesting that crops react similarly to climatic, economic, and political factors or are grown in the same periods. With this study, we substantiate previous findings that crop diversity stabilizes agricultural caloric production and extend these with regard to protein and fat. The results elucidate the key drivers that enhance production stability for different European countries and regions, which is of key importance for a comparably productive agricultural region like Europe.","2021-12","2023-09-26 16:12:23","2023-09-26 16:12:23","","","","4","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000703881000002","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;11<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;12<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;74</p>","","","Climate change; BIODIVERSITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RESILIENCE; INCREASE; Sustainability; Resilience; SECURITY; LAND; Agroecology; FOOD-PRODUCTION; YIELD STABILITY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we present a modelling and observational study of cocoa net primary productivity (NPP) in present day and future West African climates. Our analysis uses a data assimilation technique to parameterise a process-based land-surface model. The parameterisation is based on laboratory observations of cocoa, grown under both ambient and elevated CO2. Present day and end of 21st century cocoa cultivation scenarios are produced by driving the parameterised land-surface model with output from a high-resolution climate model. This represents a significant advance on previous work, because unlike the CMIP5 models, the high-resolution model used in this study accurately captures the observed precipitation seasonality in the cocoa-growing regions of West Africa-a key sensitivity for perennials like cocoa. We find that temperature is projected to increase significantly and precipitation is projected to increase slightly, although not in all parts of the region of interest. We find, furthermore, that the physiological effect of higher atmospheric CO2 concentration ameliorates the impacts of high temperature and variation in precipitation thereby reducing some of the negative impacts of climate change and maintaining NPP in West Africa, for the whole 21st Century, even under a high emissions scenario. Although NPP is an indicator of general vegetation condition, it is not equivalent to yield or bean quality. The study presented here is, nevertheless, a strong basis for further field and modelling studies of cultivation under elevated CO2 conditions.","2021-01","2023-09-26 16:12:23","2023-09-26 16:12:23","","","","1","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000600805200001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;7<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;7<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;48</p>","","","climate change; TEMPERATURE; FRAMEWORK; PRECIPITATION; ELEVATED CO2; FUTURE; agriculture; Africa; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; ACCLIMATION; cocoa; ENVIRONMENT SIMULATOR JULES; RISING CO2; STOMATAL CONDUCTANCE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This technique has mainly been used to model paleoenvironments, but has the capacity to aid conservation by quantifying how communities are structured through space and time. Here we test the relationship between limb proportions and the habitat ecology of South American non-human primates. There is a significant but weak fit between limb proportions and habitat, consistent with the environment exerting weak selective pressure on limb proportions. In contrast, body size and phylogeny are strongly correlated with IMI. Together, these findings suggest that habitat was a selection pressure that shaped how New World monkeys' limb proportions evolved but this selection pressure was secondary to that of body size. Research into these functional relationships is important not only to improve scientific understanding of their evolutionary pathways but also in order to aid their protection by informing conservation practices. Ensuring these species have the capacity to move with their niche is an immediate concern, as they face mounting pressure due to deforestation of the Amazon basin.","2021","2023-09-26 16:12:23","2023-09-26 16:12:23","","55-59","","1","32","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000697570600007","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;52</p>","","","climate change; FUNCTIONAL TRAITS; ecology; primates ecometrics; SPECIALIZATION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of our research was to determine if socio-economic and climatic changes affected the ecosystem of a deep dam reservoir which is used for drinking water. A 30-years data series showed that suburbanization did not negatively affect the quality of the water. Moreover, 30 years of socio-economic and political changes resulted in land use changes (increase of forest from 45 to 50% and decrease of agricultural land from 53 to 43%) and better management of the catchment, as well as the modernization and introduction of new technologies. Furthermore, simultaneous climatic changes affected various physical and chemical features of the studied reservoir, and the most important finding is that the thermal stratification period is extended as an effect of global warming (begins earlier and lasts longer). The complexity of the processes contributing to the functioning of the ecosystem is large, so some processes might be a result of synergistic effects of global warming and socio-economic changes. Our 30-year monitoring study explicitly shows how the ecosystem of a deep dam reservoir reflected these changes. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The Atlantic Forest is one of the most distinguished forest types in Brazil, encompassing the Araucaria Forest. In this study, we assessed the seasonal carbon production from litterfall. Data were collected every season from 27 litter traps. Dry matter and carbon fraction were investigated and confronted with meteorological variables. Litterfall components were stratified into Brazilian pine leaves and twigs: broadleaved leaves, twigs, bark, reproductive material, and other material (miscellaneous). The Tukey test indicated significant differences among the carbon fractions for litter components. Seven key species were determinant in litterfall production. Brazilian pine leaves and twigs were the primary carbon source to the forest, followed by leaves and twigs from broadleaved species. Most carbon input from litterfall comes during spring and summer. We concluded that litterfall is a source of carbon and nutrient to the ecosystem.

We quantify this bias in the case of Burkina Faso, with a panel of 45 provinces and 14 years for the three most widely grown cereals: maize, millet and sorghum. Grain yields are sensitive to weather shocks. If these shocks reduce grain yield by 10%, the price of grain increases by 2-3%. The price bias is significant, since the welfare loss is 20% to 70% higher than that calculated by assuming exogenous prices.

This article describes a pilot exercise inspired by the recommendation domain literature that aimed at mapping, beyond ""classical"" biophysical and socio-technical variables, the institutional variables (i.e., the existence of policy incentives in national policy documents) that could influence the large-scale implementation of climate-smart agricultural practices. Four practices were considered: cereal-legume intercrop-ping, fodder legume cultivation, farmer managed natural regeneration (FMNR) of Parkia biglo-bosa, and crop residue mulching. The biophysical and socio-technical variables were classified based on thresholds identified in the literature and mapped with a geographic information sys-tem. The policy documents considered were investment plans, adaptation plans for climate change, nationally determined contributions, and Technology Needs Assessments project reports. Sixteen policy documents for four countries were thoroughly reviewed and classified as unfa-vorable, intermediate, and favorable for the four selected practices, based on a decision tree built for that purpose. Our analysis shows that areas where biophysical, socio-technical, and institu-tional variables are aligned for the four practices considered are small, particularly for fodder legume cultivation and crop residue mulching. For cereal-legume intercropping, incentives from national policies strongly differ from one country to another while for FMNR of Parkia biglobosa policies are more homogeneously conducive across countries. Nonetheless, it was possible to identify areas where biophysical, socio-technical, and institutional dimensions of the transition toward climate-smart agriculture (CSA) were aligned, for example, cereal-legume intercropping in southern Mali. The delineating of favorable and unfavorable areas allows specific recommendations to be made for policymakers as levers for action differ in favorable, interme-diate, and unfavorable zones. Based on the exploration made for the four practices, this study highlights the need for further articulations from local to national scale to implement CSA.","2021-03","2023-09-26 16:12:22","2023-09-26 16:12:22","","","","","37","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000632549600003","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;9<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;9<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;91</p>","","","SOIL; Climate change; GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; INTERVENTIONS; LESSONS; SMALLHOLDER FARMERS; CONSERVATION AGRICULTURE; AVAILABILITY; CROP PRODUCTION; Innovation; INTENSIFICATION; Recommendation domains; RECOMMENDATION DOMAINS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study evaluates whether a process-based, energy balance snow model supplied with high-resolution statistically downscaled temperature and precipitation data can effectively simulate snow water equivalent (SWE) in the mountainous terrain of this region. Daily values of SWE from 1951 to 2018 are simulated at 1-km resolution and evaluated using a reanalysis SWE product [Snow Data Assimilation System (SNODAS)], manual snow-survey measurements at 41 sites, and automated snow pillows at six locations in the study region. Simulated SWE matches observed interannual variability well (R-2 > 0.8 for annual maximum SWE), but peak SWE biases of 20%-40% occur at some sites in the study domain, and higher biases occur where observed SWE is very low. Modeled SWE displays lower bias relative to SNODAS reanalysis at most manual survey locations. Future projections for the study area are produced using 12 downscaled climate model simulations and are used to illustrate the impacts of climate change on SWE at 1 degrees, 2 degrees, and 3 degrees C of warming. Model results are used to quantify spring SWE changes at different elevations of the Whistler mountain ski resort and the sensitivity of annual peak SWE in the Metropolitan Vancouver municipal watersheds to moderate temperature increases. The results both illustrate the potential utility of a process-based snow model and identify areas where the input meteorological variables could be improved. Significance StatementUsing high-resolution (1 km) climate data, we evaluate and apply a snow model in the mountainous terrain of coastal, southwestern British Columbia, Canada. Modeling snow water equivalent at high-resolution enables better representation of snow conditions that can vary widely over short distances and elevations. At 1 degrees, 2 degrees, and 3 degrees C of warming, future snow water equivalent levels at sites nearer the coast are more vulnerable to temperature increases than sites slightly higher in elevation and farther inland. Future efforts to improve the climate data may yield better agreement between simulated and observed snow levels in certain locations.","2022-01","2023-09-26 16:12:22","2023-09-26 16:12:22","","77-95","","1","61","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000759866400004","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;55</p>","","","RIVER-BASIN; Climate change; PRECIPITATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; IMPACTS; CMIP5; Snowpack; Complex terrain; TEMPERATURE-INDEX","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Temperature, relative humidity and precipitation in these years were found to have varied in Antalya. In the May-October period of 2018, the totals of average and maximum temperature were seen higher than in 2017 as opposed to the total of minimum temperature, but the distribution of temperature, relative humidity and precipitation varied according to months. While the genotypes affected by this situation had taller height and more fruiting branches in 2018, they created fewer vegetative branches, had a lower ginning outturn and fewer bolls. On the other hand, while the in Flash cultivar the number of bolls decreased in 2018, in Gloria the loss ratio of bolls minimized. Furthermore, in Sure Grow 125 the seed cotton yield per boll increased and the yield reduced, lower ginning outturn and boll losses were observed that affected fiber yield.

Within this scope, the Euphrates-Tigris Basin, a snow-fed transboundary river with several large dams, was selected to investigate the effects of changing climate on seasonal snow and runoff. In this study, two headwater basins of the Euphrates River, ranging in elevation between 1500-3500 m, were assigned and SWAT was employed as a hydrological modeling tool. Model calibration and validation were conducted in a stepwise manner for snow and runoff consecutively. For the snow routine, model parameters were adjusted using MODIS daily snow-covered area, achieving hit rates of more than 95% between MODIS and SWAT. Other model parameters were calibrated successively and later validated according to daily runoff, reaching a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.64-0.82 in both basins. After the modeling stage, the focus was drawn to the impacts of climate change under two different climate scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) in two 30-year projection periods (2041-2070 and 2071-2099). From the results, it is estimated that on average snow water equivalent decreases in the order of 30-39% and snow-covered days shorten by 37-43 days for the two basins until 2099. In terms of runoff, a slight reduction of at most 5% on average volume is projected but more notably, runoff center-time is expected to shift 1-2 weeks earlier by the end of the century.","2021-07","2023-09-26 16:12:22","2023-09-26 16:12:22","","","","14","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000677129100001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;15<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;15<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;83</p>","","","climate change; SOIL; RUNOFF; STREAMFLOW; BASIN; SWAT; COVER; CALIBRATION; HYDROLOGY; Turkey; EQUIVALENT; QUALITY MODEL; snow; WATER ASSESSMENT-TOOL","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While much of the climate change and migration discourse is invested in quantitative predictions and debates about whether migration is adaptive or maladaptive, less attention has been paid to the voices of the people moving in the context of climate change with a focus on their health and wellbeing. This qualitative research aims to amplify the voices of migrants themselves to add nuance to dominant migration narratives and to shed light on the real-life challenges migrants face in meeting their health needs in the context of climate change. Methods: We conducted 58 semi-structured in-depth interviews with migrants purposefully selected for having moved from rural Bhola, southern Bangladesh to an urban slum in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis under the philosophical underpinnings of phenomenology. Coding was conducted using NVivo Pro 12. Findings: We identified two overarching themes in the thematic analysis: Firstly, we identified the theme ""A risk exchange: Exchanging climate change and health risks at origin and destination"". Rather than describing a ""net positive"" or ""net negative"" outcome in terms of migration in the context of climate change, migrants described an exchange of hazards, exposures, and vulnerabilities at origin with those at destination, which challenged their capacity to adapt. This theme included several sub-themes-income and employment factors, changing food environment, shelter and water sanitation and hygiene (WaSH) conditions, and social capital. The second overarching theme was ""A changing health and healthcare environment"". This theme also included several sub-themes-changing physical and mental health status and a changing healthcare environment encompassing quality of care and barriers to accessing healthcare. Migrants described physical and mental health concerns and connected these experiences with their new environment. These two overarching themes were prevalent across the dataset, although each participant experienced and expressed them uniquely. Conclusion: Migrants who move in the context of climate change face a range of diverse health risks at the origin, en route, and at the destination. Migrating individuals, households, and communities undertake a risk exchange when they decide to move, which has diverse positive and negative consequences for their health and wellbeing. Along with changing health determinants is a changing healthcare environment where migrants face different choices, barriers, and quality of care. A more migrant-centric perspective as described in this paper could strengthen migration, climate, and health governance. Policymakers, urban planners, city corporations, and health practitioners should integrate the risk exchange into practice and policies.","2021-03","2023-09-26 16:12:22","2023-09-26 16:12:22","","","","5","18","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000628110200001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;12<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;12<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;42</p>","","","climate change; migration; health; MIGRATION; healthcare","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Statistical forecasting methods based on regressing summer flow against spring snow water equivalent, precipitation, and antecedent runoff are thus becoming increasingly inadequate for water-resources decision making, which can lead to missed opportunities in maximizing beneficial uses, including the value of hydropower resources. An enhanced forecasting method using a process-based model and spatially distributed wireless sensor data offers more accurate runoff forecasts. In this paper, we assessed the forecasting accuracy of these two forecasting methods by applying them to two tributaries within the North Fork Feather River basin in California. The result shows the enhanced forecasting method having better accuracy than the statistical model. In addition, a hydropower simulation showed a considerable increase in energy value with the enhanced forecasting informing reservoir operations. The investment analysis on applying this method shows an average internal rate of return of 31% across all scenarios, making this forecasting method an attractive way to better inform water-related decisions for hydropower generation in the context of climate change.","2021-08","2023-09-26 16:12:22","2023-09-26 16:12:22","","","","16","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000690168900001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;28</p>","","","climate change; hydropower; CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS; hydrology forecast","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These unique simulations have allowed European and African climate scientists to understand the critical role that the representation of convection plays in the ability of a contemporary climate model to capture climate and climate change, including many impact-relevant aspects such as rainfall variability and extremes. There are significant improvements in not only the small-scale characteristics of rainfall such as its intensity and diurnal cycle, but also in the large-scale circulation. Similarly, effects of explicit convection affect not only projected changes in rainfall extremes, dry spells, and high winds, but also continental-scale circulation and regional rainfall accumulations. The physics underlying such differences are in many cases expected to be relevant to all models that use parameterized convection. In some cases physical understanding of small-scale change means that we can provide regional decision-makers with new scales of information across a range of sectors. We demonstrate the potential value of these simulations both as scientific tools to increase climate process understanding and, when used with other models, for direct user applications. We describe how these ground-breaking simulations have been achieved under the U.K. Government's Future Climate for Africa Programme. We anticipate a growing number of such simulations, which we advocate should become a routine component of climate projection, and encourage international coordination of such computationally and human-resource expensive simulations as effectively as possible.","2021-06","2023-09-26 16:12:21","2023-09-26 16:12:21","","E1206-E1223","","6","102","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000730597800001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;22<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;22<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;92</p>","","","RAINFALL; Climate change; MODEL; SCALE; INFORMATION; SURFACE-TEMPERATURE; EXTREME PRECIPITATION; Climate models; Climate prediction; Convective storms; DEEP CONVECTION; EXPLICIT CONVECTION; Model evaluation/performance; REPRESENTATION; SAHEL","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite extensive resources allocated to downscaling climate projections and advances in understanding past, current, and future climatic conditions, climate information is underutilized in decisions made by agricultural producers. Climate information providers need to understand why this information is underutilized and what would better meet the needs of producers. To better understand how agricultural producers perceive and utilize climate information, we conducted five focus groups with farmers and ranchers across Montana. Focus groups revealed that there are fundamental scalar issues (spatial and temporal) that make climate information challenging for producers to use. While climate information is typically produced at regional, national, or global spatial scales and at a seasonal and mid- to end-of-century temporal scales, producers indicated that decision-making takes place at multiple intermediate and small temporal and spatial scales. In addition, producers described other drivers of decision-making that have little to do with climate information itself, but rather aspects of source credibility, past experience, trust in information, and the politics of climate change. Through engaging directly with end-users, climate information providers can better understand the spatial and temporal scales that align with different types of agricultural producers and decisions, as well as the limitations of information provision given the complexity of the decision context. Increased engagement between climate information providers and end-users can also address the important tradeoffs that exist between scale and uncertainty.","2021-04-21","2023-09-26 16:12:21","2023-09-26 16:12:21","","","","","3","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001023165800001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;83</p>","","","climate change; DROUGHT; RISK; SCIENCE; DECISION-MAKING; MANAGEMENT; CHANGE ADAPTATION; adaptation; PERCEPTIONS; climate communication; climate services; agricultural decision-making; climate decision-making; climate information; FORECASTS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Compared with intensity, frequency changes are less well-studied and past work has largely been constrained to analysis of well-instrumented regions. We exploit the latest ERA5 reanalysis and its global hourly accumulations at 1/4 degrees spatial resolution and apply a metric that captures frequency changes across both wet and dry regions. According to ERA5 and in a global average sense, during 1989-2018, hourly events that occurred once per year in 1979-1988 increased in frequency by 71 (53-93, 95% range) %, while the one day per year heavy event frequency increased by 44 (37-54) %. Thus, hourly events that occurred once per year in the baseline decade are on track to double in frequency by 2021-2030, and the daily events by 2047-2056. Furthermore, our results replicate prior findings that relative frequency increases are larger for increasingly rare events, and for the first time we quantify that mean frequency increases have been greater over ocean than land. Ocean increases are larger by factors of 3.0 and 2.1 for the hourly and daily events that occurred once per year in 1979-1988, respectively.","2021-07","2023-09-26 16:12:21","2023-09-26 16:12:21","","","","7","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000670762800001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;16<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;16<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;54</p>","","","climate change; TEMPERATURE; TRENDS; CLIMATE; extreme precipitation; EXTREME PRECIPITATION; FUTURE CHANGES; EVENTS; INDEXES; INTENSIFICATION; GAUGE; reanalysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this context, we review the literature on climate change consortium with abiotic stress highlighting the scenario of this nutritionally valuable crop plant and its elicited responses at morphological, physiological, biochemical and phytochemical levels. Besides, 'omic' architecture of the plant toward multiple stress factors is also discussed as a report of its first kind. Despite significant knowledge gaps that still exist, it is evident that climate change is going to influence the abiotic stress tolerance mechanisms in plants in general and maize in particular. While broad generalizations are not yet possible, because the specific plant responses towards one type of stress at one time or multiple stresses differ considerably. However, a better understanding of underlying response mechanisms regulated in the face of climate change-associated abiotic stress is needed to safeguard the optimal resilience and productivity of the maize.","2021-09","2023-09-26 16:12:21","2023-09-26 16:12:21","","","","9","43","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000690899200001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;8<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;8<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;204</p>","","","Climate change; CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS; CROP PRODUCTION; Abiotic stress; ABSCISIC-ACID; DROUGHT-STRESS; GENE-EXPRESSION; GENOME-WIDE IDENTIFICATION; HEAT-SHOCK PROTEINS; Maize; SECONDARY METABOLISM; TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS; ZEA-MAYS L.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using data obtained from bias-corrected regional climate modelling (RCM) outputs, future seasonal drought is investigated over the water-scarce Arab domain using SPI-3. The climate modelling outputs include three downscaled mainframe GCMs downscaled using a single RCM for two climate scenarios: RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Results across the region exhibit spatial and temporal variability. For example, Rift Valley, in the eastern sub-Sahara, projects less frequent and less severe drought, particularly during the winter (DJF) months. Conversely, the Morocco Highlands and adjacent Mediterranean coast signals a dramatic increase in drought by end-century during winter (DJF) and spring (MAM). Moderate increase in drought indicated in the greater Mashreq in spring (MAM) can be linked to sand and dust storm risk. Thirdly, autumn drought (SON) is linked to increased forest fire risk in the Levant.

Focusing on the roles of organized elite power, this study investigates the drivers of the formulation of RPS rollback (goal freeze) and termination bills, which we refer to collectively as negative policy experimentations. We find that RPS termination attempts are explained by the presence of ALEC legislators and anti-renewable energy business groups, whereas RPS goal freeze bills are better explained by conditions of policy operations.

To date, the majority of work that has explored the impacts of climate change on human populations has taken a migration-centred perspective, with an emphasis on mobility as a key response in crises, including extreme climatic events and civil conflict. However, evidence suggests that people may alternatively - and pro-actively - adopt a different approach involving ""staying"" as a climate change adaptation strategy. This is important as recent evolutionary approaches to resilience have highlighted how resilience is an on-going process of adaptation which emphasises the temporal, fluid and open-ended aspects of individuals' experiences and practices in shaping everyday lives. In turn, this means that individuals' experiences and practices can lead to different strategies of staying (as well as moving) in the face of climate change. Consequently, the paper highlights four key areas where more research is required in order to explore the links between climate change, `staying' and resilience. These include the importance of historical context in disentangling and contextualising the ""multicausal"" nature of individuals' mobility decisions; translocal networks in shaping mobility or immobility; the influence of equity, diversity and gendered social expectations on staying; and the importance of governance responses in facilitating resilience, adaptation and subsequent decisions by individuals to stay or move.","2021-05","2023-09-26 16:12:21","2023-09-26 16:12:21","","192-196","","","121","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000647647300020","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;8<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;8<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;63</p>","","","Climate change; CONTEXT; RESILIENCE; Adaptation; VULNERABILITY; Resilience; MIGRATION; REMITTANCES; ATTACHMENT; HOME; PLACE; Staying .","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Feeling comfortable delivering CCE was correlated with reported resource availability, with most teachers considering only basic literacy was a greater funding priority. Teachers supported an action-based CCE curriculum including issues of global social justice, beginning in primary school with mitigation projects such as conservation, local tree-planting and family advocacy.

Understanding physiological processes and water-use efficiency (WUE) of soybean offer information on bridging this yield gap. A field study was conducted in 2017 and 2018 seasons in two agroecologies (Angonia and Ruace) in Mozambique to evaluate the effects of Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens strain USDA110 formerly known as Bradyrhizobium japonicum inoculant, nitrogen and phosphorus on nodulation, physiology and yield of non-promiscuous (Safari) and promiscuous (TGx 1740-2F) soybean varieties. Data on transpiration, photosynthesis, leaf area index, radiation interception and WUE from the beginning of flowering to maturity were collected. Transpiration rate varied considerably with interaction between locations, growth stages, varieties and treatments. At podding, phosphorus-treated soybean at Angonia transpired less (6.3 mmol/m(2)/s) than check plants (6.6 mmol/m(2)/s). Photosynthesis rate and WUE were distinct with variety, growth stages and inputs within agroecologies. For instance, in Angonia 2018 season, phosphorus fertilized TGx 1740-2F photosynthesized more at flowering (25.3 mu mol/m(2)/s) while the lowest was phosphorus-treated Safari at podding with 17.2 mu mol/m(2)/s. At the same site in 2017, inoculated soybean photosynthesized more at 22.8 mu mol/m(2)/s leading to better WUE of 3.6 that corresponded to 2894 kg/ha yield. Overall, soybean WUE was higher when inoculated than N-treated, while P application yielded better. Results from this study will complement breeders' effort in developing phosphorus efficient varieties suited for a wide range of changing climatical conditions.","2021-07","2023-09-26 16:12:20","2023-09-26 16:12:20","","349-362","","5-6","159","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000726410600006","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;51</p>","","","climate change; yield; EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; YIELD; TRANSPIRATION; Agroecologies; determinate; DROUGHT TOLERANCE; FIXATION; NUTRITION; STRAINS; VARIETIES","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To advance, we look at the record of all available rain gauges in Colombia and at the CHIRPS database to estimate trends in essential variables describing precipitation, including HY-INT, an index of the hydrologic cycle's intensity. Most of the gauges and cells do not show significant trends. Moreover, the signs of the statistically significant trends are opposite between the two datasets. Satisfactory explanation for the discrepancy remains open. Among the CHIRPS database's statistically significant trends, the western regions (Pacific and Andes) tend to a more intense hydrologic cycle, increasing both intensity and mean dry spell length, whereas for the northern and eastern regions (Caribbean, Orinoco, and Amazon), the tendencies are opposite. This dipole in trends suggests different mechanisms: ENSO affects western Colombia more directly, whereas rainfall in the eastern regions depends more on the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, and Amazon basin dynamics. Nevertheless, there is countrywide accord among gauges and cells with significant increasing trends for annual precipitation. Overall, these observations constitute essential evidence of the need for developing a more satisfactory theory of climate change effects on tropical precipitation.","2021-07","2023-09-26 16:12:20","2023-09-26 16:12:20","","","","7","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000676518400001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;55</p>","","","climate change; CLIMATE; FEEDBACKS; TROPICAL ANDES; colombia; precipitation trends","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this case study is, first, to investigate the city-wide spatial distribution of common restaurants and vegan and vegetarian restaurants (which in general contribute to sustainable food consumption), with reference to popular tourist attractions. Second, the research focuses on quantity of meatless dishes and the way they are presented on menus in order to investigate whether food service establishments nudge customers to select meat-based dishes. For the first objective, quadrat and network analyses were used to explore the spatial location of the investigated types of restaurants. For the second one, a comprehensive examination of menus of 21 restaurants at the Old Town Square, which is the most overcrowded place in Prague, was conducted. The findings suggest that vegan and vegetarian restaurants are not exposed to the tourist market as their distribution is rather dispersed, beyond the borders of the UNESCO area.

Over the 2-month exposure to the experimental conditions, mussels were fed optimally to ensure that there are no synergistic interactions between climate change drivers and energetic status of the individuals. In general, regardless of origin (Atlantic or Mediterranean), the mussels were rather resilient to acidification for most of the parameters considered and they were able to grow in strongly acidified seawater through an increased feeding activity. However, shell strength decreased (40%) consistently in both mussel populations held in moderately and highly acidified seawater. The observed reduction in shell strength was not explained by slight alterations in organic matter, shell thickness or aragonite:calcite ratio. The combined effects of high acidification and warming on the key response of byssus strength caused a strong decline in mussel performance, although only in Galician mussels, in which the valve opening time decreased sharply as well as condition index (soft tissue state) and shell growth. By contrast, the observed negative effect of highly acidified scenario on the strength of Tunisian mussel shells was (partly but not totally) counterbalanced by the higher seawater temperature. Eco-physiological and behavioural interactions in mussels in relation to climate change are complex, and future scenarios for the ecology of the species and also the feasibility of cultivating them in Atlantic and Mediterranean zones are discussed.","2021-02-04","2023-09-26 16:12:20","2023-09-26 16:12:20","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000635663700001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;9<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;9<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;85</p>","","","climate change; IMPACTS; ENVIRONMENT; CO2; OCEAN ACIDIFICATION; ALKALINITY; BIOMINERALIZATION; ecophysiology; ELEVATED-TEMPERATURE; Marine mussel; PARTICLE RETENTION; SEAWATER ACIDIFICATION; SHELL FORMATION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Projections of regional climate models for three different time intervals were applied for the simulation of predictive scenarios. The investigated regional climate model projections predict rising annual average temperature and generally dropping annual rainfall rates throughout the following decades. Based on predictive modelling, recharge rates and groundwater levels are expected to drop in elevated geographic areas such as the Alpokalja, the Eastern parts of the Transdanubian Mountains, the Mecsek, and Northern Mountain Ranges. Less significant groundwater level drops are predicted in foothill areas, and across the Western part of the Tiszantul, the Duna-Tisza Interfluve, and the Szigetkoz areas. Slightly increasing recharge and groundwater levels are predicted in the Transdanubian Hills and the Western part of the Transdanubian Mountains.

The communities of San Luis de Chibuleo and Atillo, located in the cantons of Ambato and Mocha, respectively, were selected based on two criteria: 1) that they are communities located near the moorlands and 2) that their main production is livestock. Given that the communities do not have a database on cattle ranchers, a non-probabilistic sampling was applied and 49 and 28 interviews were conducted, respectively. In addition, 12 soil samples taken between 20 and 30 cm depth were analyzed: six in the community of San Luis de Chibuleo and six in Atillo. In each community, three soil samples were taken from soils where potatoes were grown and three from soils cultivated with pasture. The results indicate that on average the families have 5 cattle units per family. Livestock intensification also had favorable effects such as increased fertility in pasture soils (12.67% OM and 75.67 ppm of nitrogen), milk supply for family consumption (2 l/day), generation of permanent income for the family (between 307 to 504 USD/month). And adverse effects such as pressure on the paramo ecosystem due to animal grazing; reduction of the area of agricultural crops (potatoes) and greater food dependence on other agricultural products. However, agriculture has a greater negative impact on soils and the environment due to the high use of pesticides. In this scenario, the presence of communities in these territories generates anthropic effects. On the other hand, the local population is obliged to use these resources for the reproduction of their livelihood systems. The results suggest incorporating agroecological practices and balancing the components: livestock, agriculture and forestry in the agricultural productive units of this type of communities that, faced with the need for economic resources, have no other alternative but to use the resources of the environment.","2022-01","2023-09-26 16:12:20","2023-09-26 16:12:20","","","","1","31","","","","","","","","","","Spanish","","","","WOS:000797037500012","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;35</p>","","","climate change; CHALLENGES; livestock; paramos; pasture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In response, they are developing climate action plans that also support their sustainable development goals, but conventional adaptation approaches such as hard flood defenses can be expensive and unsustainable. Nature-based solutions (NbS) could provide cost-effective options to address these challenges but policymakers lack evidence on their effectiveness. To address this knowledge gap, we focused on Bangladesh, which is exceptionally vulnerable to cyclones, relative sea-level rise, saline intrusion, floods, landslides, heat waves and droughts, exacerbated by environmental degradation. NbS have been implemented in Bangladesh, but there is no synthesis of the outcomes in a form accessible to policymakers. We therefore conducted a systematic review on the effectiveness of NbS for addressing climate and natural hazards, and the outcomes for other sustainable development goals. Research encompasses protection, restoration and participatory management of mangroves, terrestrial forests and wetlands, as well as conservation agriculture and agro-forestry, but there is an evidence gap for urban green infrastructure. There is robust evidence that, if well-designed, these NbS can be effective in reducing exposure to natural disasters, adapting to climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions while empowering marginalized groups, reducing poverty, supporting local economies and enhancing biodiversity. However, we found short-term trade-offs with local needs, e.g. through over-harvesting and conversion of ecosystems to aquaculture or agriculture. To maximize NbS benefits while managing trade-offs, we identified four enabling factors: support for NbS in government policies; participatory delivery involving all stakeholders; strong and transparent governance; and provision of secure finance and land tenure, in line with international guidelines. More systematic monitoring of NbS project outcomes is also needed. Bangladesh has an opportunity to lead the way in showing how high quality NbS can be deployed at landscape scale to tackle sustainable development challenges in low to middle income countries, supporting a Green Economic Recovery. Our evidence base highlights the value of protecting irreplaceable natural assets such as mangroves, terrestrial forests and wetlands, and the non-market benefits they deliver, in national planning policies.","2021-11-22","2023-09-26 16:12:20","2023-09-26 16:12:20","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000744031900001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;96</p>","","","nature-based solutions; resilience; PRODUCTIVITY; MANAGEMENT; climate policy; CHANGE ADAPTATION; climate change adaptation; governance; CONSERVATION; climate change mitigation; SYSTEMS; Bangladesh; AGROFORESTRY; CHITTAGONG HILL TRACTS; FORESTRY; PROFITABILITY; sustainable development goals; TILLAGE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Climate projections simulate the response to radiative forcing, but are subject to substantial uncertainties due to internal variability. Decadal climate predictions aim to reduce this uncertainty by initializing the simulations using observations, but are typically limited to the next 10 years. Here, we use decadal predictions to constrain climate projections beyond the next decade and demonstrate that accounting for climate variability improves regional projections of 20-year average temperatures. Applying this constraint to climate projections of the near future until 2035, summer temperatures over land regions in Asia and Africa tend to show stronger changes within the warming range simulated by the larger, unconstrained, ensemble-consistent with a warm phase in North Atlantic variability.

The research further explores valuers' considerations of climate change-related risks. Design/methodology/approach The research approach comprised an online survey of Australian valuers who were members of the Australian Property Institute. The online survey included structured and unstructured questions to explore types and extent of risk investigations in valuation practice. Findings The analysis reflects that while valuers easily identified and engaged with physical risks, there is a lack of understanding of, and engagement with, climate change risks. This supports the need for better information sources and guidance to inform valuers of climate change risks per se, as well as the development of specific mechanisms for consideration of such risks to be included in valuation processes, practices and reports. Research limitations/implications The research is limited by the small sample size achieved due to the timing of the survey deployment, which occurred during the first wave of COVID-19 lockdowns in Australia. Thus, the findings are not necessarily representative of the Australian valuation profession, but they do provide indications of current approaches to risk identification in practice and the need for more guidance in relation to climate change risks. Practical implications This research identifies that more support, guidance, information and tools, as well as awareness-raising, are required to enable valuers to accurately identify all risks affecting a property.

It has been hypothesized that slow internal developments often made societies less resilient over time, setting them up for collapse. Here, we provide quantitative evidence for this idea. We use annual-resolution time series of building activity to demonstrate that repeated dramatic transformations of Pueblo cultures in the pre-Hispanic US Southwest were preceded by signals of critical slowing down, a dynamic hallmark of fragility. Declining stability of the status quo is consistent with archaeological evidence for increasing violence and in some cases, increasing wealth inequality toward the end of these periods. Our work thus supports the view that the cumulative impact of gradual processes may make societies more vulnerable through time, elevating the likelihood that a perturbation will trigger a large-scale transformation that includes radically rejecting the status quo and seeking alternative pathways.","2021-05-04","2023-09-26 16:12:20","2023-09-26 16:12:20","","","","18","118","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000651325500003","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;11<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;11<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;63</p>","","","climate change; MODEL; CLIMATE; POPULATION; resilience; INDICATORS; archaeology; collapse; AGE; COLLAPSE; EARLY-WARNING SIGNALS; SLOWING-DOWN; SUNK-COST","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Crop simulation models can provide useful insight on the effects of increasing temperatures and rising CO2 concentrations [CO2] as well as rainfall variations. In this study, the LINTUL4 model was used to study the sensitivity effect of five temperature (T) levels (-3, 0, 3, 6, and 9 degrees C above/below minimum/maximum temperatures), three precipitation (W) changes (30% decrease, baseline and 30% increase), and CO2 levels (baseline(360), 450, 540, 630 and 720ppm) on nutrient limited yield (Yn), water limited yield (Yw), water and nutrient limited yield (Ynw) and potential yield (Yp) of potato crop in high-input Washington, USA and low-input Gisozi, Burundi. The maximum weight of the tuber yield and aboveground biomass for Yp and Yw in Gisozi, and Yn and Yp in Washington was observed at combinations of lower temperature and elevated [CO2]. For Gisozi, maximum tuber yield for Yn and Ynw was observed at [CO2] of less than 720ppm. The results suggest that nutrient supply will continue to be the major limiting factor for potato production under elevated [CO2] in Gisozi, and water availability will limit Yw and Ynw rain-fed production in Washington. Generally, the LINTUL4 model performs well with few data input, but fails to predict the differential effect of high temperature on assimilate partitioning to aboveground and belowground biomass.","2021","2023-09-26 16:12:19","2023-09-26 16:12:19","","5-30","","1","115","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000668566300001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;58</p>","","","SIMULATION; RESPONSES; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; CARBON-DIOXIDE; ELEVATED CO2; Climate Change; MAIZE; DRY-MATTER; LEAF-AREA; LINTUL4; PLANT-GROWTH; Potato yield; WHEAT","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We determined trajectories of climate change-related worry over adolescence and whether these were associated with depression symptoms and greater engagement with news and politics in late adolescence. Methods At ages 10-11, 12-13, 16-17 and 18-19 years, adolescents participating in the Kindergarten cohort of the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children rated their worry about climate change. At age 18-19 years, participants reported on depression symptoms and engagement with news and politics. Latent profile analysis determined trajectories of climate change-related worry across all time points (N = 2244). Linear regression analyses examined the association between trajectories and outcomes at 18-19 years. Results Thirteen per cent (n = 290) of adolescents had high persistent worry. The largest proportions had moderate (n = 559, 24.9%) or increasing worry (n = 546, 24.3%), followed by persistent low worry (n = 376, 16.8%), slightly decreasing worry (n = 297, 13.2%) and steeply decreasing worry (n = 176, 7.8%). Adolescents with high persistent worry had higher depression symptoms at age 18-19 years compared to the moderate group, while those with increasing worry did not. The high persistent and increasing worry groups reported greater engagement with news and politics across several measures. Conclusion This is the first study to track climate-related worry and outcomes in young people across adolescence. A substantial number of Australian adolescents experience high or increasing worry about climate change, which is associated with greater societal engagement.","2022-02","2023-09-26 16:12:19","2023-09-26 16:12:19","","22-29","","1","27","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000717601500001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;18<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;18<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;39</p>","","","Climate change; social change; HOPE; PERCEPTIONS; EMOTION; anxiety; GRIEF; adolescence; ANXIETY; depressive symptoms","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By means of double regression, we evaluate linear combinations of the logarithm of the carbon dioxide concentration and the geomagnetic aa index as a proxy for solar activity. Thereby, we reproduce the sea surface temperature (HadSST) since the middle of the 19th century with an adjusted R2 value of around 87 percent for a climate sensitivity (of TCR type) in the range of 0.6 K until 1.6 K per doubling of CO2. The solution of the double regression is quite sensitive: when including data from the last decade, the simultaneous occurrence of a strong El Nino and of low aa values leads to a preponderance of solutions with relatively high climate sensitivities around 1.6 K. If these later data are excluded, the regression delivers a significantly higher weight of the aa index and, correspondingly, a lower climate sensitivity going down to 0.6 K. The plausibility of such low values is discussed in view of recent experimental and satellite-borne measurements. We argue that a further decade of data collection will be needed to allow for a reliable distinction between low and high sensitivity values. In the second part, which builds on recent ideas about a quasi-deterministic planetary synchronization of the solar dynamo, we make a first attempt to predict the aa index and the resulting temperature anomaly for various typical CO2 scenarios. Even for the highest climate sensitivities, and an unabated linear CO2 increase, we predict only a mild additional temperature rise of around 1 K until the end of the century, while for the lower values an imminent temperature drop in the near future, followed by a rather flat temperature curve, is prognosticated.","2021-11","2023-09-26 16:12:19","2023-09-26 16:12:19","","","","11","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000723344700001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;98</p>","","","climate change; VARIABILITY; CYCLE; solar cycle; ATMOSPHERE; NORTHERN-HEMISPHERE; AA; DECADES; forecast; GEOMAGNETIC-ACTIVITY; HEMISPHERE TEMPERATURE TRENDS; IRRADIANCE; SUN","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To investigate this relationship at the country scale, this study uses a case study in Iran to 1) measure the cooperative relationship among climate change professionals using the network analysis approach and 2) analyze the potential of the network in promoting adaptation measures based on sustainable development. Social network analysis, which is both a quantitative and qualitative method of grounded theory, was used to analyze the data. Data collection was performed using two questionnaires, including network analysis and a survey, as well as a number of semistructured interviews with the climate change professionals. The data were collected from climate change professionals, including a sample of 55 individuals who were surveyed as a cross section of representative participants from a variety of sectors and organizations. The network relationship results have been analyzed using different tests at three levels (micro, macro, and the interactions between the two). The results have shown that the connectedness of the network is 23.7%, with 42.4% mutual links. The transitivity rate in the network is 51.39%, which determines the possibility of each professional communicating with a third party. According to the normalized degree index, 34.29% of the cases are in contact with other researchers in the network and 53.15% received a connection from others.

Owing to interspecific differences in temperature adaptations and tolerances, warming may lead to changes in the fish community as a result of shifts in the abundance of co-existing species. We investigated how increased temperatures have potentially affected the abundance and catch composition of anadromous salmonids in northern Europe. We used national angling catch statistics over a period of several decades (1993-2018) as a proxy of relative annual abundance of adult Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), brown trout (Salmo trutta), and Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) in water courses in Iceland and in northern Norway. These are the only locations in the world where the three species coexist naturally as anadromous forms, and where they are distributed across latitudinal gradients characterised by varying temperatures. Interpolated data on average annual air temperatures proximate to the study rivers increased 1-1.7 degrees C in northern Norway and 1.0-1.5 degrees C in Iceland during the 26-year study period. While the overall total number of fish caught has remained relatively stable during the period of study, gradual climate warming has been accompanied by a marked change in the catch composition of the three species in both countries. Increased temperatures were related to a decreased proportion of Arctic charr and an increased proportion of brown trout, while no temperature effect was found for Atlantic salmon. Controlling for the difference between fluvial and lacustrine systems, brown trout has begun to replace Arctic charr in all regions, whereas the relative catch of Atlantic salmon has been stable. Interpretation of angling data can facilitate understanding of longer-term trends in catch data and provide insights into possible underlying changes in fish species and alert managers to shifts in abundance that might be mitigated by management actions. However, care must be taken to avoid the confounding effects that changes in fisheries management measures, angler preferences, and effort might have on the metrics of relative change used to make inferences about long-term trends.","2022-01","2023-09-26 16:12:19","2023-09-26 16:12:19","","64-77","","1","67","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000622860400001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;14<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;14<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;79</p>","","","climate change; TEMPERATURE; RIVER; GROWTH; temperature; FRESH-WATER; catch statistics; SALAR L.; salmonids; SALVELINUS-ALPINUS; SEA LICE; STOCK SIZE; thermal change; TRUTTA; WILD","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, regional climate prediction is characterized by inherent uncertainty due to the complexity of climate models. This work provides a comprehensive study to quantify the impact of climate uncertainties in projecting future renewable energy potential over five climate zones of Europe. Thirteen future climate scenarios, including five global climate models (GCMs) and three representative concentration pathways (RCPs), are downscaled by the RCA4 regional climate model (RCM) over 90 years (2010-2099), divided into three 30-year periods. Solar and wind energy production is projected considering short-/long-term climate variations and uncertainties in seven representative cities (Narvik, Gothenburg, Munich, Antwerp, Salzburg, Valencia, and Athens). The results showed that the uncertainty caused by GCMs has the most substantial impact on projecting renewable energy generation. The variations due to GCM selection can become even larger than long-term climate change variations over time. Climate change uncertainties lead to over 23% and 45% projection differences for solar PV and wind energy potential, respectively. While the signal of climate change in solar radiation is weak between scenarios and over time, wind energy generation is affected by 25%.","2022-01","2023-09-26 16:12:19","2023-09-26 16:12:19","","","","1","15","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000744259300001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;12<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;13<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;47</p>","","","climate change; MODELS; WEATHER; RESOURCES; SPEED; climate uncertainties; future climate data; POTENTIALS; POWER-GENERATION; solar energy; wind energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Appropriate procedures to assess the evolution over time of climatic actions are needed to deal with the inherent uncertainty of climate projections, also in view of providing more sound and robust predictions at the local scale. In this paper, an ad hoc weather generator is presented that is able to provide a quantification of climate model inherent uncertainties. Similar to other weather generators, the proposed algorithm allows the virtualization of the climatic data projection process, overcoming the usual limitations due to the restricted number of available climate model runs, requiring huge computational time. However, differently from other weather generation procedures, this new tool directly samples from the output of Regional Climate Models (RCMs), avoiding the introduction of additional hypotheses about the stochastic properties of the distributions of climate variables. Analyzing the ensemble of so-generated series, future changes of climatic actions can be assessed, and the associated uncertainties duly estimated, as a function of considered greenhouse gases emission scenarios. The efficiency of the proposed weather generator is discussed evaluating performance metrics and referring to a relevant case study: the evaluation of extremes of minimum and maximum temperature, precipitation, and ground snow load in a central Eastern region of Italy, which is part of the Mediterranean climatic zone. Starting from the model ensemble of six RCMs, factors of change uncertainty maps for the investigated region are derived concerning extreme daily temperatures, daily precipitation, and ground snow loads, underlying the potentialities of the proposed approach.","2021-08","2023-09-26 16:12:19","2023-09-26 16:12:19","","","","8","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000688990200001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;75</p>","","","climate change; TEMPERATURE; TRENDS; factor of change; EURO-CORDEX; PRECIPITATION EXTREMES; ENSEMBLE; extremes; climate effects; climatic actions; climatic variables; MULTISITE SIMULATION; regional climate models; weather generator","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For 68% (1,138) of the cities studied, the increase in the urban vegetation is less strong as compared to the vegetation increase found in the surroundings of these cities. Overall, positive vegetation trends are widely observed in cities in Europe and North America, whereas negative vegetation trends in cities occur primarily in Africa, South America and Asia.

Despite serious biases in correctly simulating probabilities of extreme rainfall events, model simulations under global warming scenarios are routinely used to provide estimates of future changes in these probabilities. To minimize the impact of model biases, past literature tends to evaluate fractional (instead of absolute) changes in probabilities of precipitation extremes under the assumption that fractional changes would be more reliable. However, formal tests for the validity of this assumption have been lacking. Here we evaluate two measures that address properties important to the correct simulation of future fractional probability changes of precipitation extremes, and that can be assessed with current climate data. The first measure tests climate model performance in simulating the characteristic shape of the probability of occurrence of daily precipitation extremes and the second measure tests whether the key parameter governing the scaling of this shape is well reproduced across regions and seasons in current climate. Contrary to concerns regarding the reliability of global models for extreme precipitation assessment, our results show most models lying within the current range of observational uncertainty in these measures. Thus, most models in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 ensemble pass two key tests in current climate that support the usefulness of fractional measures to evaluate future changes in the probability of precipitation extremes.","2021-02","2023-09-26 16:12:19","2023-09-26 16:12:19","","","","2","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000609436600001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;9<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;9<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;60</p>","","","climate change; RAINFALL; SIMULATION; CMIP5; global warming; climate models; FUTURE CHANGES; HYDROLOGICAL CYCLE; DISTRIBUTIONS; RESOLUTION; climate model evaluation; GLOBAL PRECIPITATION; HEAVY PRECIPITATION; precipitation extremes; SYSTEM MODEL","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Instead, by mapping out the coalition of organizations within this movement and how connections among them change over time, we see clear evidence that this youth-led movement was reoriented by adult-led organizations.

Projections of the runoff in future climate conditions are needed for long-term planning of water resources and flood protection. In this study, we evaluate the possible climate change impacts on the runoff regime in eight selected basins located in the whole territory of Slovakia. The projected runoff in the basins studied for the reference period (1981-2010) and three future time horizons (2011-2040, 2041-2070, and 2071-2100) was simulated using the HBV (Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenbalansavdelning) bucket-type model (the TUW (Technische Universitat Wien) model). A calibration strategy based on the selection of the most suitable decade in the observation period for the parameterization of the model was applied. The model was first calibrated using observations, and then was driven by the precipitation and air temperatures projected by the KNMI (Koninklijk Nederlands Meteorologisch Instituut) and MPI (Max Planck Institute) regional climate models (RCM) under the A1B emission scenario. The model's performance metrics and a visual inspection showed that the simulated runoff using downscaled inputs from both RCM models for the reference period represents the simulated hydrological regimes well. An evaluation of the future, which was performed by considering the representative climate change scenarios, indicated that changes in the long-term runoff's seasonality and extremality could be expected in the future. In the winter months, the runoff should increase, and decrease in the summer months compared to the reference period. The maximum annual daily runoff could be more extreme for the later time horizons (according to the KNMI scenario for 2071-2100). The results from this study could be useful for policymakers and river basin authorities for the optimum planning and management of water resources under a changing climate.","2021-12","2023-09-26 16:12:18","2023-09-26 16:12:18","","","","23","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000735093800001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;42</p>","","","climate change; CATCHMENT; BASINS; changes in a runoff regime; DEOPTIM; Slovakia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, expectations have been high on the recent generation of high-resolution convection-permitting regional climate models (CPRCMs), to reproduce the small-scale features of observed (extreme) rainfall that are driving small-scale hydrological hazards. Are they living up to these expectations? In this study, we zoom in on southern Sweden and investigate to which extent two climate models, a 3-km resolution CPRCM (HCLIM3) and a 12-km non-convection permitting RCM (HCLIM12), are able to reproduce the rainfall climate with focus on short-duration extremes. We use three types of evaluation-intensity-based, time-based and event-based-which have been designed to provide an added value to users of high-intensity rainfall information, as compared with the ways climate models are generally evaluated. In particular, in the event-based evaluation we explore the prospect of bringing climate model evaluation closer to the user by investigating whether the models are able to reproduce a well-known historical high-intensity rainfall event in the city of Malmo 2014. The results very clearly point at a substantially reduced bias in HCLIM3 as compared with HCLIM12, especially for short-duration extremes, as well as an overall better reproduction of the diurnal cycles. Furthermore, the HCLIM3 model proved able to generate events similar to the one in Malmo 2014. The results imply that CPRCMs offer a clear potential for increased confidence in future projections of small-scale hydrological climate change impacts, which is crucial for climate-proofing, e.g., our cities, as well as climate modeling in general.","2021-07-02","2023-09-26 16:12:18","2023-09-26 16:12:18","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000673938000001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;7<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;7<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;49</p>","","","climate change; PROJECTIONS; EURO-CORDEX; FUTURE; PRECIPITATION EXTREMES; MODEL SIMULATIONS; ENSEMBLE; climate model evaluation; climate factors; extreme rainfall; pluvial flooding; SCALES","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We developed a framework that scores the impacts of climate-change actions on all SDG targets based on directionality (i.e., trade-offs or co-benefits) and likelihood of occurrence (i.e., ubiquitous or context-dependent), and categorizes them by dependence on four key context dimensions-geographical, governance, time horizon and limited natural resources. Through an extensive literature review, we found that climate-change mitigation measures directly affect most SDGs and their targets, mostly through co-benefits. Improving energy efficiency, reducing energy-services demand and switching to renewables provide the most co-benefits. In contrast, carbon capture and storage and nuclear energy likely lead to multiple trade-offs. We show how understanding the relevant context dimensions facilitates policy design and policy mixes that enhance co-benefits and minimize trade-offs. Finally, by assessing the prevalence of climate-change mitigation measures in G20 countries, we found that measures with more co-benefits are more frequently adopted.

A well-established strategy involves the identification and addition of new areas for conservation, and most countries agreed in 2010 to expand the global protected area (PA) network to 17% by 2020 (Aichi Biodiversity Target 11). Although great efforts to expand the global PA network have been made, the potential of newly established PAs to conserve biodiversity under future climate change remains unclear at the global scale. Here, we conducted the first global-extent, country-level assessment of the contribution of PA network expansion toward three key land prioritization approaches for biodiversity persistence under climate change: protecting climate refugia, protecting abiotic diversity, and increasing connectivity. These approaches avoid uncertainties of biodiversity predictions under climate change as well as the issue of undescribed species. We found that 51% of the countries created new PAs in locations with lower mean climate velocity (representing better climate refugia) and 58% added PAs in areas with higher mean abiotic diversity compared to the available, non-human-dominated lands not chosen for protection. However, connectivity among PAs declined in 53% of the countries, indicating that many new PAs were located far from existing PAs. Lastly, we identified potential improvements for climate adaptation, showing that 94% of the countries have the opportunity to improve in executing one or more approaches to conserve biodiversity. Most countries (60%) were associated with multiple opportunities, highlighting the need for integrative strategies that target multiple land protection approaches. Our results demonstrate that a global improvement in the protection of climate refugia, abiotic diversity, and connectivity of reserves is needed to complement land protection informed by existing and projected species distributions. Our study also provides a framework for countries to prioritize land protection for climate adaptation using publicly available data.","2021-05","2023-09-26 16:12:18","2023-09-26 16:12:18","","1788-1801","","9","27","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000616969500001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;12<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;13<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;81</p>","","","climate change; climate velocity; connectivity; protected areas; abiotic diversity; climate refugia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous studies, however, have not provided conclusive results, owing to the complexity of the phenomenon and to difficulties in general circulation model (GCM) representations of PAs. Here, we diagnose PA activity in 10 years of current and projected future output from global, high-resolution (15-km mesh) time-slice simulations performed with the Model for Prediction Across Scales-Atmosphere (MPAS-A). These time slices span a range of ENSO states. They include high-resolution representations of sea surface temperatures and GCM-based sea ice for present and future climates. Future projections, based on the RCP8.5 scenario, exhibit strong Arctic amplification and tropical upper warming, providing a valuable experiment with which to assess the impact of climate change on PA frequency. The MPAS-A present-climate simulations reproduce the main centers of observed PA activity, but with an eastward shift in the North Pacific and reduced amplitude in the North Atlantic. The overall frequency of positive PAs in the future simulations is similar to that in the present-day simulations, while negative PAs become less frequent. Although some regional changes emerge, the small, generally negative changes in PA frequency and meridional circulation index indicate that climate change does not lead to increased persistence of midlatitude flow anomalies or increased waviness in these simulations.","2021-07","2023-09-26 16:12:18","2023-09-26 16:12:18","","5425-5442","","13","34","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000775651000016","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;70</p>","","","Climate change; MODEL; RESPONSES; PROJECTIONS; DYNAMICS; FREQUENCY; CIRCULATION; Climate models; Climate variability; SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; EXPERIMENTAL-DESIGN; Anomalies; ATMOSPHERIC BLOCKING; Blocking; General circulation models; NORTHERN-HEMISPHERE BLOCKING","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The environmental consequences of a 50% expansion or contraction in production were compared to Australian cotton production's current environmental footprint. Both were then assessed to investigate whether current impacts are suitable for predicting the environmental impact of a change in demand for cotton lint. Methods A consequential life cycle assessment (LCA) model of Australian cotton lint production (cradle-to-gin gate) was developed using plausible scenarios regarding domestic regions and technologies affected by changes in supply, with both expansion (additional cotton) and contraction (less cotton) being modelled. Modelling accounted for direct impacts from cotton production and indirect impacts associated with changes to cotton production, including co-product substitution and changes to related crops at regional and global scales. Impact categories assessed included climate change, fossil energy demand, freshwater consumption, water stress, marine and freshwater eutrophication, land occupation and land-use change. Results and discussion For both the expansion and contraction scenarios, the changes to climate change impacts (including iLUC) and water impacts were less than would be assumed from current production as determined using attributional LCA. However, the opposite was true for all other impact categories, indicating trade-offs across the impact categories. Climate change impacts under both scenarios were relatively minor because these were largely offset by iLUC. Similarly, under the contraction scenario, water impacts were dominated by indirect impacts associated with regional crops. A sensitivity analysis showed that the results were sufficiently robust to indicate the quantum of changes that could be expected. Conclusions A complex array of changes in technologies, production regions and related crops were required to model the environmental impacts of a gross change in cotton production. Australian cotton lint production provides an example of legislation constraining the direct water impacts of production, leading to a contrast between impacts estimated by attributional and consequential LCA. This model demonstrated that indirect products and processes are important contributors to the environmental impacts of Australian cotton lint.","2021-12","2023-09-26 16:12:18","2023-09-26 16:12:18","","2321-2338","","12","26","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000716293100001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;83</p>","","","Climate change; LAND-USE; IMPACTS; CONSUMPTION; GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; Water; Land-use change; cLCA; Cotton; DISPLACEMENT; FOOTPRINT; IRRIGATED COTTON; TRADE; WATER-USE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One part of the new climate politics entails experimentation with citizen-centric input into policy development, via mechanisms of deliberative democracy such as citizens' assemblies. Yet relatively little is known about the motivations and aspirations of those commissioning climate assemblies or about general public perceptions of these institutions. Addressing these issues is important for increasing understanding of what these deliberative mechanisms represent in the context of climate change, how legitimate, credible and useful they are perceived to be by those involved, and whether they represent a radical way of doing politics differently or a more incremental change. This article addresses these gaps by presenting findings from mixed method research on prior expectations of the Devon Climate Assembly, proposed following the declaration of a climate emergency in 2019. The research compares and contrasts the views of those commissioning and administering the citizens' assembly, with those of the wider public. Findings indicate widespread support, yet also considerable risk and uncertainty associated with holding the assembly. Enabling input into policy of a broad array of public voices was seen as necessary for effective climate response, yet there was scepticism about the practical challenges involved in ensuring citizen representation, and about whether politicians, and society more generally, would embrace the 'hard choices' required. The assembly was diversely represented as a means to unlock structural change, and as an instrumental tool to achieve behaviour change at scale. The Devon Climate Assembly appears to indicate 'cautious experimentation' where democratic innovation is widely embraced yet carefully constrained, offering only a modest example of a 'new climate politics,' with minimal challenges to the authority of existing institutions.","2021","2023-09-26 16:12:18","2023-09-26 16:12:18","","76-86","","2","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000645235800008","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;15<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;15<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;40</p>","","","climate change; climate emergency; climate politics; citizens' assemblies; climate assembly; deliberation; DEMOCRACY; democratic innovations; LEGITIMACY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They each present complex problems, as transition to low-carbon alternatives requires the reconfiguration of professional practices. This paper examines the sustainability policies of 66 UK universities to establish the extent to which planning and action in these areas are commensurate with climate emergency declarations. The findings indicate that universities recognize their role in creating demand for long-distance travel and sustaining high-carbon diets. However, few have specific emissions reduction targets or action plans that would rapidly and substantially reduce emissions in these areas. Discussion focuses on two core points; first, how greater cohesion in reporting and target-setting can be achieved across the sector to raise the ambition of targets and intervention; and second to identify opportunities for institutions to disrupt and reshape professional practices to reduce emissions in these areas. Key Policy Insights Reducing emissions in the higher education sector requires organizations to foster low-carbon academic practices by engaging with the systemic cultural and material conditions that support high-carbon academic practices. The establishment of robust targets, action plans and monitoring processes would further support sector-wide decarbonization, and require consensus across HE institutions and governing bodies. Sector-wide agreement on the level and pace of emissions reduction will help to accelerate ambition regarding Scope 3 emissions reduction and determining the appropriate contribution of different institutions will help identify where action is most urgently required. Findings suggest a need for absolute targets for emissions reduction associated with long-distance travel, and that food policies focus on achieving a volumetric reduction in the weight of meat served so that absolute levels of greenhouse gas emissions are reduced. Travel and food provision are complex aspects of university emissions, but a climate emergency framing requires all organizations to use their full range of influence to rapidly and substantially reduce emissions.","2021-08-09","2023-09-26 16:12:18","2023-09-26 16:12:18","","853-867","","7","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000623074600001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;16<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;16<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;69</p>","","","Climate change mitigation; climate change policies; emissions reduction; corporate social responsibility; education sector","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A number of previous studies used the UK Climate Projections 2009 (UKCP09) to investigate the potential impacts on river flows in Britain, but these projections were recently updated by the release of UKCP18, thus there is a need to update flow studies. Here, the UKCP18 Regional (12 km) projections are applied using a national-scale grid-based hydrological model, to investigate potential future changes in seasonal mean river flows across Great Britain. Analysis of hydrological model performance using baseline climate model data (1980-2010) shows relatively good agreement with use of observation-based data, particularly after application of a monthly precipitation bias-correction. Analysis of seasonal mean flow changes for two future time-slices (2020-2050 and 2050-2080) suggests large decreases in summer flows across the country (median -45% by 2050-2080), but possible increases in winter flows (median 9% by 2050-2080), especially in the north and west. Information on the potential range of flow changes using the latest projections is necessary to develop appropriate adaptation strategies, and comparisons with previous projections can help update existing plans, although such comparisons are often not straightforward.","2021-04","2023-09-26 16:12:17","2023-09-26 16:12:17","","","","4","35","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000645220700043","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;17<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;17<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;47</p>","","","climate change; UNCERTAINTY; IMPACTS; EVAPORATION; BIAS CORRECTION; WATER; UK; hydrological impacts; MODEL DATA; seasonal mean flow change; UK climate projections 2018; UKCP18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The quantitative analysis of vegetation dynamics including climate and human activities is necessary to take appropriate actions to adapt to climate change and optimize vegetation distribution to mitigate it. This article integrates the relationship between climate, soil, socioeconomic factors and vegetation change using redundancy analysis (RDA) and partial redundancy analysis (pRDA): which also considers the time-lag effect of climate change. The correlation between vegetation and dynamics of the three periods at land-use and vegetation group levels in the 14 counties in Heihe River basin (HRB) of China was revealed. Results showed that the most important driving factor was groundwater depth and mean annual temperature with 15-year lag times. More variation of vegetation change was determined at land-use level (54.7%) than that at vegetation group level (42.0%): Climate change factors explained more variations than human activities both at vegetation group and land-use level, so did the time-lag effect. Land use planning not is only necessary in urban area but also in rural area in HRB. To increase resilience of agriculture, we suggest appropriate grazing management strategy.

The employed technique entails the empirical-statistical downscaling method quantile mapping (QM), which is applied in two different settings, first for bias correction and downscaling of raw climate model data to rural stations with long-term measurements and second for spatial transfer of bias-corrected and downscaled climate model data to the respective urban target site. The resulting products are daily minimum and maximum temperatures at five urban sites in Switzerland until the end of the 21st century under three emission scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP8.5). We test the second-step QM approach in an extensive evaluation framework, using long-term observational data of two exemplary weather stations in Zurich. Results indicate remarkably good skill of QM in present-day climate. Comparing the generated urban climate projections with existing climate scenarios of adjacent rural sites allows us to represent the urban heat island (UHI) effect in future temperature-based heat indices, namely tropical nights, summer days and hot days. Urban areas will be more strongly affected by rising temperatures than rural sites in terms of fixed threshold exceedances, especially during nighttime. Projections for the end of the century for Zurich, for instance, suggest more than double the number of tropical nights (Tmin above 20 degrees C) at the urban site (45 nights per year, multi-model median) compared to the rural counterpart (20 nights) under RCP8.5.","2021-04","2023-09-26 16:12:17","2023-09-26 16:12:17","","","","","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000664759000010","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;58</p>","","","TEMPERATURE; Climate change; MODEL; PRECIPITATION; Climate services; MORTALITY; STRESS; EURO-CORDEX; SCENARIOS; Urban heat island; CITIES; Climate projections; BERLIN; Heat extremes; ISLAND; Urban climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Planned relocation is an important adaptive tool for governments and communities around the world dealing with human mobility due to climate change. The literature shows that planned relocations allow governments to be proactive to avoid a crisis resulting from the impacts of climate change. However, in terms of governance and policy, both at the international and national levels, a lot has been written about migration and displacement, but not enough focus is given to planned relocation. The paper, using the comparative method and qualitative analysis, will examine cases of relocation identified from different countries around the world to create a database of case studies. The paper analyses 12 cases of planned relocation which constitutes a medium-N study in comparative politics. The paper seeks to answer two main questions, namely, (a) What lessons can be learnt from cases of planned relocation due to slow-onset climate change? and (b) Can theory of agenda-setting and salience of issues explain why some cases of planned relocation happened more efficiently compared to others? Analysis reveals that lack of governance frameworks and planning are the major challenges faced by communities in both developing and developed countries choosing planned relocations. Secondly, a comparison of two cases of planned relocation, shows that the salience of the issue of planned relocation might explain how some communities fared better.","2022","2023-09-26 16:12:31","2023-09-26 16:12:31","","","","","4","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001030582800012","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;32</p>","","","CLIMATE-CHANGE; Agenda setting; Environmental protections; Human mobility due to climate change; Pacific region; Planned relocation due to climate change; Slow-onset climate change","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The sequence of peacemaking events between farming and nomadic groups in northern China from the Western Han to the Qing dynasty was constructed based on historical documents. We analyzed the impacts of climate change on ethnic relationships using war and temperature sequence data from previous studies. The main results are as follows: 1) There were 504 peacemaking events between farming and nomadic groups, with an average frequency of 2.4 times per decade. Paying tribute (68.9%) occurred significantly more frequently than intermarriage for pacification (31.1%). The sequences showed different stages. 2) There were more peacemaking events during cold periods and fewer during warm periods. Intermarriage for pacification played a greater role in peacemaking during warm periods, while paying tribute was more important during cold periods. 3) High-incidence stages of war and of peacemaking events alternated. Peacemaking events occurred more frequently during cold periods and wars occurred more frequently during warm periods. 4) During warm periods, farming and nomadic groups had enough power to contend with each other, wars occurred frequently, and intermarriage was often used for peacemaking. During cold periods, agriculture and animal husbandry declined, both sides weakened, and the power difference between them usually increased. Wars rarely occurred, and paying tribute was often used for peacemaking. Ethnic relationships are affected by many factors. As a background factor influencing land productivity, climate indirectly affected conflict-resolution measures between farming and nomadic groups. We can hereby consider ways to manage interregional ethnic relationships under global climate change today. Significance Statement Because of a lack of research, this study aims to construct the long-term and high-resolution sequence of peacemaking events between farming and nomadic groups in northern China to depict ethnic relationships with both war and peacemaking and explore how climate change affects them comprehensively. Findings showed that the groups chose war or peacemaking and decided whether the means of peacemaking would be intermarriage for pacification or paying tribute to resolve conflicts of interest according to the power gap influenced by climate change, which could provide a historical reference for dealing with the competition between groups for resources caused by global climate change today. Future work should explore the response mechanisms of ethnic relationships to climate change more comprehensively and deeply.","2021-04","2023-09-26 16:12:31","2023-09-26 16:12:31","","327-339","","2","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000642533200010","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;48</p>","","","VARIABILITY; Climate change; CHANGE IMPACTS; Societal impacts; CLIMATE-CHANGE ADAPTATION; CONFLICT; HISTORY; COLLAPSE; History; WARS; WESTERN HAN DYNASTY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moreover, the consequences of fetal exposure to rainfall variability are strongly apparent in the child's first year of life and linger to some extent at later ages. Our heterogeneity analyses further show that children of disadvantaged backgrounds, such as poor and uneducated households, are especially vulnerable to rainfall variability during gestation.

However, few studies have investigated seasonality of mortality under a warming climate. Methods Daily mean temperature, daily counts for all-cause, circulatory, and respiratory mortality, and annual data on prefecture-specific characteristics were collected for 47 prefectures in Japan between 1972 and 2015. A quasi-Poisson regression model was used to assess the seasonal variation of mortality with a focus on its amplitude, which was quantified as the ratio of mortality estimates between the peak and trough days (peak-to-trough ratio (PTR)). We quantified the contribution of temperature to seasonality by comparing PTR before and after temperature adjustment. Associations between annual mean temperature and annual estimates of the temperature-unadjusted PTR were examined using multilevel multivariate meta-regression models controlling for prefecture-specific characteristics. Results The temperature-unadjusted PTRs for all-cause, circulatory, and respiratory mortality were 1.28 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.27-1.30), 1.53 (95% CI: 1.50-1.55), and 1.46 (95% CI: 1.44-1.48), respectively; adjusting for temperature reduced these PTRs to 1.08 (95% CI: 1.08-1.10), 1.10 (95% CI: 1.08-1.11), and 1.35 (95% CI: 1.32-1.39), respectively. During the period of rising temperature (1.3 degrees C on average), decreases in the temperature-unadjusted PTRs were observed for all mortality causes except circulatory mortality. For each 1 degrees C increase in annual mean temperature, the temperature-unadjusted PTR for all-cause, circulatory, and respiratory mortality decreased by 0.98% (95% CI: 0.54-1.42), 1.39% (95% CI: 0.82-1.97), and 0.13% (95% CI: - 1.24 to 1.48), respectively.

This study elucidates that anthropogenic N fluxes (ANFs) from atmospheric and river deposition exacerbate Arctic warming and sea ice loss via physical-biological feedback. The impact of physical-biological feedback is quantified through a suite of experiments using a coupled climate-ocean-biogeochemical model (GFDL-CM2.1-TOPAZ) by prescribing the preindustrial and contemporary amounts of riverine and atmospheric N fluxes into the Arctic Ocean. The experiment forced by ANFs represents the increase in ocean N inventory and chlorophyll concentrations in present and projected future Arctic Ocean relative to the experiment forced by preindustrial N flux inputs. The enhanced chlorophyll concentrations by ANFs reinforce shortwave attenuation in the upper ocean, generating additional warming in the Arctic Ocean. The strongest responses are simulated in the Eurasian shelf seas (Kara, Barents, and Laptev Seas; 65 degrees-90 degrees N, 20 degrees-160 degrees E) due to increased N fluxes, where the annual mean surface temperature increase by 12% and the annual mean sea ice concentration decrease by 17% relative to the future projection, forced by preindustrial N inputs.","2021-05","2023-09-26 16:12:30","2023-09-26 16:12:30","","3799-3819","","10","34","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000644153200005","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;112</p>","","","Climate change; MODEL; OCEAN; PART I; Arctic; CARBON; SEA-ICE LOSS; ANTHROPOGENIC NITROGEN; BASE-LINE; DYNAMICAL CORE; FUTURE CLIMATE-CHANGE; Ocean models; PHYTOPLANKTON","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Global environmental and developmental changes, as well as national political decisions, open up Russia's Arctic to massive investment and industrial and socioeconomic development. How do Russian Arctic cities, towns, and municipalities reflect on new opportunities in terms of designing their climate change adaptation strategies at a local level? Starting with theoretical discourse on urban climate change adaptation strategy, this research examines state-of-the-art challenges and trends in planning for adaptation measures in Russia's Arctic industrial centers. Special attention is given to a comparative analysis of the cities' climate change adaptation strategies. The role of civil society institutions and business community in the adaptation strategy planning process is explored. Moreover, conflict-sensitive approaches to ensure participatory processes for designing and implementing adaptation measures are discussed. The field component of research is based on the cities of Apatity, Arkhangelsk, Murmansk, Norilsk, Salekhard, and Severodvinsk and the towns of Monchegorsk, Nickel, and Vorkuta. The study concludes that, despite significant challenges identified, the total ""balance sheet'' of the Arctic cities' efforts to enhance their adaptive capacities is very positive: Russian northern urban settlements do their best in addressing existing challenges via planning for sustainability approach. However, there is more to do, and municipalities should learn from one another's experiences, as the different approaches can be helpful in developing adequate climate change adaptation strategies at the local level.","2021-10","2023-09-26 16:12:30","2023-09-26 16:12:30","","875-884","","4","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000750001100012","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;46</p>","","","Climate change; Adaptation; Arctic; Planning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to the strong link between climate and the hydrological cycle, water resources is one of the most affected fields by climate change. It is of great importance to investigate climate change effects on streamflows by producing future streamflow projections under different scenarios to create adaptation measures and mitigate potential impacts of climate change. The Upper Campaspe Catchment (UCC), located at North Central Victoria in Australia, is a significant catchment as it provides a large portion of total inflow to the Lake Eppalock Reservoir, which supplies irrigation to the Campaspe Irrigation district and urban water to Bendigo, Heathcote, and Ballarat cities. In this study, climate change effects on monthly streamflows in the UCC was investigated using high resolution future climate data from CSIRO and MIROC climate models in calibrated IHACRES hydrological model. The IHACRES model was found to be very successful to simulate monthly streamflow in UCC. Remarkable streamflow reductions were projected based on the climate input from both models (CSIRO and MIROC). According to the most optimistic scenario (with the highest projected streamflows) by the MIROC-RCP4.5 model in near future (2035-2064), the Upper Campaspe River will completely dry out from January to May. The worst scenario (with the lowest streamflow projection) by the CSIRO-RCP8.5 model in the far future (2075-2104) showed that streamflows will be produced only for three months (July, August, and September) throughout the year. Findings from this study indicated that climate change will have significant adverse impacts on reservoir inflow, operation, water supply, and allocation in the study area.","2021-09","2023-09-26 16:12:30","2023-09-26 16:12:30","","","","3","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000699618300001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;26</p>","","","climate change; RUNOFF; STREAMFLOW; MODELS; streamflow; Campaspe River","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Resulting impacts materialize in the form of devastating bushfires, flooding, hurricanes, and cyclones and bring with them the tragic loss of life and substantial loss and damage to phenomena of value. Disaster management plays a central role in attempting to minimize and manage these impacts, and many government institutions posit that shared responsibility with citizens is the most effective approach to achieve this. However, some scholarship contends that shared approaches preference responsibility too far towards citizens and too far away from government institutions and are ineffective in lessening and managing such impacts. Here, we analyze governmental inquiries and actions undertaken regarding three past catastrophic disasters-2005 Hurricane Katrina (USA), the 2009 Victorian Bushfires (Australia), and the 2011 Queensland Floods (Australia). We assess, across these inquiries, 'what went wrong', 'what was working', and 'what needs fixing' with shared responsibility in disaster management. Our results indicate pervasive ineffectiveness in leadership, governance, trust, and resilience. We discuss how neoliberal influence contributes towards this ineffectiveness and suggest how this influence can be actively contested. We conclude by advocating for a reinstated social contract that inserts citizen rights and justice into disaster management policy making concomitant with the redistribution of public and third sector resources administered through inclusive governance frameworks. Such a social contract affords citizens greater opportunity to exercise agency whilst maximizing institutional support before, during, and after a disaster to provide greater protection and reduce harm.","2021-09","2023-09-26 16:12:30","2023-09-26 16:12:30","","","","","63","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000688624600003","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;10<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;10<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;150</p>","","","Climate change; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RISK; RESILIENCE; Resilience; SECURITY; GOVERNMENT; CRITIQUE; INQUIRIES; Leadership; LEADERSHIP; NATIONALISM; Neoliberalism; NEOLIBERALISM","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whilst the risk is small compared with many other countries, recent fires have raised awareness and highlighted the potential for environmental damage and loss of property and key infrastructure. Most UK wildfires are a result of inadvertent or deliberate human action, but the environmental conditions depend on antecedent and current weather. This paper presents projections of the effects of climate change on UK wildfire danger, using a version of an operational fire danger model, UKCP18 climate projections representing low and high emissions, and several indicators of fire danger. Fire danger will increase across the whole of the UK, but the extent and variability in change varies with indicator. The absolute danger now and into the future is greatest in the south and east (the average number of danger days increases 3-4 times by the 2080s), but danger increases further north from a lower base. The variation in change across the UK for indicators based on absolute thresholds is determined by how often those thresholds are exceeded now, whilst the (lesser) variability in percentile-based indicators reflects variability in the projected change in climate. Half of the increase in danger is due to increased temperature, and most of the rest is due to projected reductions in relative humidity. Uncertainty in the magnitude of the change is due to uncertainty in changes in temperature, relative humidity, and rainfall, and there is a large difference between two of the UKCP18 climate model ensembles. Reducing emissions to levels consistent with achieving international climate policy targets significantly reduces, but does not eliminate, the increase in fire danger. The results imply that greater attention needs to be given to wildfire danger in both emergency and spatial planning, and in the development of guidelines for activities that may trigger fires. They suggest the need for the development of a fire danger system more tailored to UK conditions, and the combination of fire danger modelling with projections of sources of ignition to better estimate the change in wildfire risk.","2021-04","2023-09-26 16:12:30","2023-09-26 16:12:30","","","","4","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000632373800001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;9<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;9<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;32</p>","","","climate change; RISK; wildfire; WEATHER; UK; UKCP18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our work is motivated by three factors: (a) some regions are seeing increasing volatility SOS timing; (b) SOS represents the first observable occurrence in the agricultural season and starts a chain reaction of decisions that influence planting, labor allocation, and harvest-all of which can have direct impacts on local food prices and availability; and (c) pre- and post-harvest price movements provide key insights into supply-and-demand issues related to food insecurity. We start by exploring a number of different SOS definitions using varying reference periods to define whether an SOS is 'on-time' or 'late'. We then compare how those different definitions perform in seasonal price forecasting models. Specifically, we examine if SOS indicators can predict price means over 6 and 9 month periods, or roughly the length of time from planting to market. We use different reference periods for defining 'early' versus 'late' seasonal starts based on the previous year's start date, or median start dates over the past 3, 5, and 10 year periods. We then compare the out-of-sample forecast performance of univariate time-series models (autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)) with time-series (ARIMAX) models that include various SOS definitions as exogenous predictors. We find that using some form of SOS indicator (either an SOS anomaly or 1st month's rainfall anomaly) leads to increased predictive power when examining prices over a 6 months window. However, the results vary considerably by country. We find the strongest performance of SOS indicators in central Ethiopia, southern Kenya, and southern Somalia. We find less evidence in support of the use of SOS indicators for price forecasting in Malawi and Mozambique.","2021-08","2023-09-26 16:12:30","2023-09-26 16:12:30","","","","8","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000682151700001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;55</p>","","","climate change; MODEL; SCIENCE; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; TIME-SERIES; ONSET; food security; MAIZE; forecasting; PASTORAL MOBILITY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our analysis develops two mechanisms - enablement and theorization - to explain the relationship between theory performativity and power within a process of translation. This contributes to (1) the performativity debate by showing how the constitution of power relations shapes theory performativity; (2) theories of power, by tracing the ways in which certain actors are able to enrol others and impact the authority of particular theories, and (3) processes of translation by developing mechanisms for following the ways in which power and theory performativity interact.

This method is useful because it involves the quantitative analysis of large amounts of literature, using mathematical and statistical method. The results showed that the United States (US), the United Kingdom (UK), and China were the countries with the most published papers in the field. The US plays a key role in the cooperation between international institutions. An assessment conducted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) created the standard scientific reference for the research on climate change and its consequences. From 2006 to 2016, a large number of co-cited papers laid a solid foundation for research in the field. During this period, the research focused on the impact of climate change on the ecological environment, began to propose different countermeasures, and formed a set of mature research methods. From 2017 to 2019, there was an acceleration in the growth rate of the number of published articles. Strategies to address climate change, including renewable energy and energy transition, were the focus during this phase. Future studies are expected to focus on climate change mitigation strategies and energy policies.

Catchment and water management, organisations, industry, farmers and local governments are all confronting the effects of climate change, which stimulate the growth of cyanobacteria and affect the efficacy of adaptation measures in water systems. To tackle climate change and CyanoHABs growth, actors at different levels require both 'top-down' and 'bottom-up' assessments to help them in formulating and implementing adaptation measures. Potential solutions must also be assessed locally to limit associated adverse effects, in particular, negative effects on water quality. Thus, having a better understanding of the synergies, conflicts and trade-offs between adaptation practices and climate-change effects on CyanoHABs makes a valuable contribution to a more integrated climate policy and the effective climate-proofing of our water bodies. This article examines adaptation practices focused on tackling CyanoHABs occurrence in a changing climate. It fills an important gap between a major environmental problem and potential solutions. The practices and measures advanced as a result of the analysis can be used by persons with different expertise and skill levels for improving the relevant institutional frameworks and policies to protect their local water bodies.","2021","2023-09-26 16:12:30","2023-09-26 16:12:30","","1722-1734","","12","72","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000688500400001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;109</p>","","","climate change; TEMPERATURE; WATER-QUALITY; CAPACITY; adaptation; NITROGEN; CO2; EUTROPHICATION; LAKE; PHYTOPLANKTON; cyanobacteria; eutrophication; PHOSPHORUS; RIPARIAN BUFFER ZONES","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

From this and similar observations, many of the papers conclude that there is a need for shifting to a new approach on how climate policy makers may relate to climate change uncertainties. The article proposes such a shift by presenting a road map on how to address uncertainties in climate change adaptation. It consists of three major elements: first, to accept that in many cases we will not be able to reduce climate change uncertainties; second, to diversify the way in which we describe climate change uncertainties, moving from a one-dimensional technical perspective to a multidimensional perspective that applies uncertainties also to social and political processes and systems; and third, to change the way we address climate change uncertainties by moving from a predict-then-act to a reflect-then-act approach, implying that we must adapt to climate change even under high and varied forms of uncertainties. Embedded in this last point is to accept that, unlike for climate change mitigation, the precautionary principle will apply in many situations of climate change adaptation. In the last part of the article the usability of the proposed road map is demonstrated post ante on four Norwegian cases of climate-related natural hazard events.","2022-01","2023-09-26 16:12:29","2023-09-26 16:12:29","","","","1","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000798743300001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;51</p>","","","IMPACT; RISK; CHANGE ADAPTATION; OVERCOMING BARRIERS; Rivers; Uncertainty, Climate Change, Adaptation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we examine future changes to the positive-phase ENSO teleconnection to the North Pacific/North America sector and investigate the mechanisms involved. We find that the positive temperature anomalies over Alaska and northern North America that are associated with an El Nino event in the present day are much weaker, or of the opposite sign, in the CMIP6 abrupt 4xCO(2) experiments for almost all models (22 out of 26, of which 15 have statistically significant differences). This is largely related to changes to the anomalous circulation over the North Pacific, rather than differences in the equator-to-pole temperature gradient. Using a barotropic model, run with different background circulation basic states and Rossby wave source forcing patterns from the individual CMIP6 models, we find that changes to the forcing from the equatorial central Pacific precipitation anomalies are more important than changes in the global basic state background circulation. By further decomposing this forcing change into changes associated with the longitude and magnitude of ENSO precipitation anomalies, we demonstrate that the projected overall eastward shift of ENSO precipitation is the main driver of the temperature teleconnection change, rather than the increase in magnitude of El Nino precipitation anomalies, which is nevertheless seen in the majority of models.","2021-08","2023-09-26 16:12:29","2023-09-26 16:12:29","","6191-6205","","15","34","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000672642500011","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;9<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;9<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;40</p>","","","VARIABILITY; Climate change; PRECIPITATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; IMPACT; PROJECTIONS; MODELS; OCEAN; PATTERNS; TROPICAL PACIFIC; Teleconnections; El Nino; ROSSBY-WAVE PROPAGATION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The increase is strongly weighted to the Northern Hemisphere, and especially noteworthy is a large increase in the higher latitudes of the North Atlantic. Changes are insignificant in the South Pacific across metrics. Although the largest increases in track density are far from land, substantial increases in global landfalling power dissipation are indicated.

Pen culture can be an effective climate-resilient technology for enhancing fish production in shallow, macrophyte-choked, and multi-stake floodplain wetlands, especially in eastern and north-eastern India. In this context, pen culture was implemented as an adaptive measure in a tropical Gangetic wetland (Mathura) to enhance fish production and increase the adaptive capacity of fishers. Indian Major Carps, Gibelion catla, Labeo rohita, and Cirrhinus mrigala of initial size 10.4 +/-.21g, 8.2 +/- 0.48g, and 6.5 +/- 0.23g respectively, were stocked at the ratio of 4:4:2 and at the rate of 30 fish m(-2) each in pens of 100 m(2) in duplicate. For purposes of conservation, Labeo bata and Gudusia chapra, 4.3 +/- 0.18g and 3.8 +/-.34g initial size, respectively, were stocked at the rate of 20 Nos.m(-2) each at the ratio of 1:1. The fish were fed with commercial feed at the rate of 4% of body weight. A net survival of 82%, 87%, and 75% was recorded in Indian Major Carps, L. bata and G. chapra. A production of 380 kg IMC was achieved during 120 days of the culture period. L. bata achieved an average weight of 21.40 +/- 0.34g during the 90-day culture period, with a survival rate of 87%. G. chapra attained an average weight of 16.5 +/- 0.42g during the culture period, with a recorded survival rate of 75%. G. chapra was observed to spawn in the pen. The water quality inside pens and reference sites did not differ significantly (p>0.05). The produced fish were released in the wetland for fisheries enhancement. The present communication discusses the technological suitability and economic feasibility of adopting climate-resilient pen culture as an adaptation measure for enhancing the adaptive capacity of wetland fishers in the face of a changing climate.","2021-07","2023-09-26 16:12:29","2023-09-26 16:12:29","","83-93","","3","24","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000748868300010","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;37</p>","","","climate change; resilience; adaptation; livelihood; RESILIENT; TECHNOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The coincident decrease in slope stability frequently affects infrastructure by creep and subsidence and promotes the generation of rockfalls and rockslides. The increasing hazard posed by warming permafrost rock walls and the growing exposure of infrastructure and individuals create a demand for quantitative monitoring methods. Laboratory-calibrated electrical resistivity tomography provides a sensitive record for frozen versus unfrozen bedrock, presumably being the most accurate quantitative monitoring technique in permafrost areas where boreholes are not available. The data presented here are obtained at the permafrost-affected and unstable Steintaelli Ridge at 3100 m a.s.l. and allow the quantification of permafrost changes in the longest electrical resistivity tomography time series in steep bedrock. Five parallel transects across the rock ridge have been measured five times each, between 2006 and 2019, with similar hardware. Field measurements were calibrated using temperature-resistivity laboratory measurements of water-saturated rock samples from the site. A 3D time-lapse inversion scheme is applied in the boundless electrical resistivity tomography (BERT) software for the inversion of the data. To assess the initial data quality, we compare the effect of data filtering and the robustness of final results with three different filters and two time-lapse models. We quantify the volumetric permafrost distribution in the bedrock and its degradation in the last decades. Our data show mean monthly air temperatures to increase from -3.4 degrees C to -2.6 degrees C between 2005-2009 and 2015-2019, respectively, while simultaneously permafrost volume degraded on average from 6790 m(3) (+/- 640 m(3) rock in phase-transition range) in 2006 to 3880 m(3) (+/- 1000 m(3)) in 2019. For the first time, we provide a quantitative measure of permafrost degradation in unstable bedrock by using a temperature-calibrated 4D electrical resistivity tomography. Our approach represents a fundamental benchmark for the evaluation of climate change effects on bedrock permafrost.","2021-10","2023-09-26 16:12:29","2023-09-26 16:12:29","","625-625","","5","19","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000680025800001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;1</p>","","","Climate change; 3D; ERT; Geohazard","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, we measured larval release from captive colonies of a common Indo-Pacific reef coral, Seriatopora caliendrum, between October 2018 and December 2019. The largest larvae release event occurred in May 2019, and the smallest one occurred in September 2019. Several coral reproductive features demonstrated a close connection with seawater temperature. In contrast to prior studies conducted at the same institute with corals belonging to the same genus, of the same average size, originating from the same site, and cultured under the same conditions, we documented decreased fecundity of Seriatopora corals ex situ in 2018-2019. Various types of disturbance influence the study site from which corals were originally collected.

As a case study we consider a region in the NE Atlantic under present and future climate conditions, using a time-slice method and global and nested regional ocean models. The high resolution regional model reproduces the strong seasonal cycle in submesoscale activity observed under present-day conditions. Focusing on the well-resolved winter months, in the future, with a reduction in the MLD, there is a substantial reduction in submesoscale activity, an associated decrease in kinetic energy (KE) at the mesoscale, and the vertical buoyancy flux induced by submesoscale activity is reduced by a factor of 2. When submesoscale activity is suppressed, by increasing the parameterized lateral mixing in the model, the climate change induces a larger reduction in winter MLDs while there is less of a change in KE at the mesoscale. A scaling for the vertical buoyancy flux proposed by (Fox-Kemper et al., 2008; doi:10.1175/2007JPO3792.1) based on the properties of mixed layer instability (MLI), is found to capture much of the seasonal and future changes to the flux in terms of regional averages as well as the spatial structure, although it over predicts the reduction in the flux in the winter months. The vertical buoyancy flux when the mixed layer is relatively shallow is significantly greater than that given by the scaling based on MLI, suggesting during these times other processes (besides MLI) may dominate submesoscale buoyancy fluxes.","2021-05","2023-09-26 16:12:28","2023-09-26 16:12:28","","","","5","126","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000654462400011","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;11<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;13<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;49</p>","","","climate change; SYSTEM; PART I; FLOW; PHYTOPLANKTON; EDDIES; FORMULATION; MESOSCALE; MIXED-LAYER INSTABILITIES; PHYSICS; STRATIFICATION; submesoscale; vertical fluxes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study was based on a comparative analysis of Dniester water discharge in periods before (1951-1980) and after (1991-2015) this complex construction, using observation data at hydrological posts located at the entrance to the Dniester reservoir (Zalishchyky) and downstream of its dam (Mohyliv-Podilskyi and Bender). Compared statistics included annual and seasonal trends and averages of water discharge in two periods, and statistical significance of their differences. It was shown that a statistically significant increase of Dniester flow in 1951-1980 was later replaced by its small decrease, explained both by changes in basinwide climate and DHPC functioning manifested in transforming the river flow seasonal distribution. Accumulation of water in the Dniester reservoir has led to a decrease in the annual flow volumes by above 6% directly below its dam and about 9%-in the Lower Dniester. As a result, the role of the Upper Dniester' catchment, located in the Ukrainian Carpathians, sharply increased; now it provides 80% of the Dniester annual flow compared with 69% before DHPC construction. Another 11% of flow is formed by Dniester's tributaries in its sub-catchment from Zalishchyky to Mohyliv-Podilskyi and 9%-in its downstream part. Concerning the seasonal streamflow, a challenging reduction is evident in spring due to water accumulation for hydropower needs in DHPC reservoirs, which negatively affects the Low Dniester ecosystems. On the whole, in 1991-2015 the Dniester annual flow decreased from 10.22 to 9.15 km(3).","2021-02-09","2023-09-26 16:12:28","2023-09-26 16:12:28","","","","4","80","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000617756600003","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;34</p>","","","Climate change; Hydropower; Dniester River","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, research works evaluating the agronomic impact of quinoa cultivation out of the Andean region are still limited, especially under Mediterranean field conditions. In this work, the agronomic performance, seed composition and nutrient uptake (NU) of five quinoa varieties were analysed in two consecutive years (2017-2018) under field conditions in Southwestern Europe. High temperatures were recorded during 2017 growing season, resulting in significantly lower yields (1.6 t/ha) compared to 2018 (2.5 t/ha). High-temperature stress coincided with flowering stage in those medium-to-long cycle varieties and was well correlated with detrimental effects on the vegetative stage of short and medium cycle varieties. Seed composition and mineral content of quinoa varied among varieties subjected to heat stress, which could be due to differences in the stress response. Protein and fibre contents were higher under high temperatures, while fats and carbohydrates contents decreased. Nutrient uptake, utilisation and partitioning were reduced under heat stress, probably due to heat-protection mechanisms and associated biochemical changes. Early maturing varieties showed better adaptation, especially Marisma, which achieved the highest yield in both years (3.0 t/ha, on average). Overall, the results here presented support to the potential of quinoa cultivation in Europe highlighting the necessity to further explore varieties better adapted to elevated temperatures, a common stress affecting the Mediterranean area.","2021-06","2023-09-26 16:12:28","2023-09-26 16:12:28","","481-491","","3","207","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000640873000001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;24<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;25<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;52</p>","","","ADAPTATION; climate change; TEMPERATURE; IMPACT; RESPONSES; heat stress; USE EFFICIENCY; AMARANTH; CHENOPODIUM-QUINOA; GLOBAL EXPANSION; PROTEIN; quinoa; WILLD.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study assessed the underline causes of livelihood vulnerability in a flood prone rural area surrounded by riverine Jhok Reserve forest of Punjab Province. Using Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI), eight potential components were inquired from two hundred natural-resource dependent households. Two approaches of LVI were customized to incorporate indigenous knowledge into 42 sub-components. The findings of the study showed that local people had poor socio-economic conditions, which led to have a wide networking gap in the community. People have become highly vulnerable to climatic changes because of higher environmental degradation in form of riverbank erosion, deforestation, etc. It was revealed that community in Jhok Reserve Forest had low adaptive capacities mainly due to higher poverty, low education level and lack of awareness about future disasters. And this has exposed them being unable to adapt to environmental changes. The findings of the study are significant for the policy makers to analyze the root causes of livelihood vulnerability and formulate agricultural adaptations for other rural communities.

This article explores the experiences of climate strike leaders in Aotearoa New Zealand questioning the motivational factors behind the youth action. In-depth interviews with 15 climate strike leaders identified emotions that influenced engagement and could motivate action. Climate strike leaders reported experiencing a series of turbulent emotional stages from apathy to action. Their experiences suggest that anxiety and anger are important stages in the emotional journey towards action. Using Boler's Pedagogy of Discomfort, this paper examines these emotional stages that can disable or enable action. Considering youth perspectives increases our understanding of a suitable climate change educational framework that potentially supports both educators and students on this challenging journey.","2022-03","2023-09-26 16:12:28","2023-09-26 16:12:28","","13-25","","1","38","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000725304200001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;7<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;7<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;52</p>","","","climate change; youth; education; action; ANGER","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examine changes in extreme precipitation represented by annual maxima of 1-day (Rx1day) and 5-day (Rx5day) precipitation accumulations at different spatial scales and attempt to address whether the signal in extreme precipitation has strengthened with several years of additional observations. Extreme precipitation has increased at about two-thirds of stations and the percentage of stations with significantly increasing trends is significantly larger than that can be expected by chance for the globe, continents including Asia, Europe, and North America, and regions including central North America, eastern North America, northern Central America, northern Europe, the Russian Far East, eastern central Asia, and East Asia. The percentage of stations with significantly decreasing trends is not different from that expected by chance. Fitting extreme precipitation to generalized extreme value distributions with global mean surface temperature (GMST) as a covariate reaffirms the statistically significant connections between extreme precipitation and temperature. The global median sensitivity, percentage change in extreme precipitation per 1 K increase in GMST is 6.6% (5.1% to 8.2%; 5%-95% confidence interval) for Rx1day and is slightly smaller at 5.7% (5.0% to 8.0%) for Rx5day. The comparison of results based on observations ending in 2018 with those from data ending in 2000-09 shows a consistent median rate of increase, but a larger percentage of stations with statistically significant increasing trends, indicating an increase in the detectability of extreme precipitation intensification, likely due to the use of longer records.","2021-01","2023-09-26 16:12:28","2023-09-26 16:12:28","","243-258","","1","34","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000615484800015","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;95<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;98<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;62</p>","","","RAINFALL; TEMPERATURE; Climate change; CLIMATE; AUSTRALIA; Precipitation; Extreme events; INTENSE PRECIPITATION; OBSERVED TRENDS; CANADA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whilst the policy dynamics of these interventions are starting to slowly emerge, less is known about the interface of policy-politics-evidence for NBS. This paper argues that there is a role that public environmental agencies acting as boundary actors can play in the successful brokering of knowledge about NBS into policy. Situated loosely within boundary conceptual approaches, it offers an empirical case study of a UK public boundary agency seeking to broker knowledge about NBS into national policy making forum, which are highly political. The results show that this agency utlises four key tools for navigating 'the political' in brokering evidence about NBS into policy: communications and framing, embedding, selectivity, and lobbying. These findings reveal new insights about how public agencies navigate the free market of knowledge production through a four-part tool kit. It concludes by offering suggestions for the wider applicability of the research to the still emerging field of policy for NBS.","2022-01","2023-09-26 16:12:27","2023-09-26 16:12:27","","303-310","","","127","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000723255100004","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;70</p>","","","ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; Climate change; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MANAGEMENT; INSIGHTS; BENEFITS; Agentification; Boundary actors; BOUNDARY ORGANIZATIONS; KNOWLEDGE BROKERS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, it has recently been shown that thermal effects on reproduction, especially limits to male fertility, can underpin species distributions in insects. However, the physiological factors influencing fertility at high temperatures are poorly understood. Key factors that affect somatic thermal tolerance such as hardening, the ability to phenotypically increase thermal tolerance after a mild heat shock, and the differential impact of temperature on different life stages are largely unexplored for thermal fertility tolerance. Here, we examine the impact of high temperatures on male fertility in the cosmopolitan fruit fly Drosophila virilis. We first determined whether temperature stress at either the pupal or adult life history stage impacts fertility. We then tested the capacity for heat-hardening to mitigate heat-induced sterility. We found that thermal stress reduces fertility in different ways in pupae and adults. Pupal heat stress delays sexual maturity, whereas males heated as adults can reproduce initially following heat stress, but become sterile within seven days. We also found evidence that while heat-hardening in D. virilis can improve high temperature survival, there is no significant protective impact of this same hardening treatment on fertility. These results suggest that males may be unable to prevent the costs of high temperature stress on fertility through heat-hardening, which limits a species' ability to quickly and effectively reduce fertility loss in the face of short-term high temperature events.","2021-12","2023-09-26 16:12:27","2023-09-26 16:12:27","","18238-18247","","24","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000724110500001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;8<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;8<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;43</p>","","","climate change; POPULATIONS; TOLERANCE; reproduction; HIGH-TEMPERATURE; BUZZATII; DOWN-REGULATION; HSP70 EXPRESSION; INDUCED MALE-STERILITY; MATING SUCCESS; plasticity; sterility","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous work applied gain and norm framing. In this experiment, two hedonic framings (e.g., color, emoticons) are added. Discrete choice experiments with 1985 Canadian drivers were used to determine willingness-to-pay for CO2 emissions reductions. Of the frames tested, the two hedonic additions of color and emoticons resulted in the greatest increases in willingness-to-pay. Carbon tax framing was the least influential.

Further, degradation of common property resources, uncertainty in crop yields, increased soil salinity, farm unemployment and reduction in consumption were some of the potential non-climatic impacts as perceived by the farmers. As climate adaptation measures, farmers resorted to disease/heat tolerant varieties, plant protection chemicals and water conservation techniques. Moreover, lack of access to institutional credit, poorly defined property rights, inadequate infrastructure and information gaps were some of the major barriers to climate adaptation in the region.

Different populations of mosquitoes initiate diapause in response to a specific photoperiod, or daylength, resulting in population-specific differences in annual cycles of abundance. The photoperiod that causes approximately 50% of a population to initiate diapause is known as the critical photoperiod (CPP). The autumn daylength corresponding to the CPP in the field likely marks the day beyond which the photoperiods would trigger and maintain 50% or more diapause incidence in a population, although temperature, diet, and other factors can impact diapause initiation. In the Northern Hemisphere, northern populations of mosquitoes experience lower temperatures earlier in the year and must be triggered into diapause by longer daylengths than southern populations. CPP is genetically based, but also adapts over time responding to the population's environment. Therefore, CPP has been shown to lengthen with increasing latitude and altitude. While the positive correlation between CPP and latitude/altitude has been established in a few mosquito species, including Aedes albopictus (Skuse, Diptera: Culicidae), Aedes triseriatus, Aedes sierrensis, and Wyeomyia smithii (Coquillett, Diptera: Culicidae), we do not know when most other species initiate their seasonal responses. As several of these species transmit important diseases, characterizing the CPP of arthropod vectors could improve existing control by ensuring that surveillance efforts align with the vector's seasonally active period. Additionally, better understanding when mosquitoes and other vectors initiate diapause can reduce the frequency of chemical applications, thereby ameliorating the negative impacts to nontarget insects.","2021-07","2023-09-26 16:12:27","2023-09-26 16:12:27","","1610-1618","","4","58","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000684159600011","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;90</p>","","","climate change; TEMPERATURE; diapause; VECTOR; AEDES-SIERRENSIS DIPTERA; ALBOPICTUS DIPTERA-CULICIDAE; CULEX-PIPIENS DIPTERA; invasive species; LARVAL DIAPAUSE; MOLECULAR PHYSIOLOGY; PITCHER-PLANT MOSQUITO; TREE-HOLE MOSQUITO; WEST-NILE-VIRUS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, how species-specific responses to climate change= affect interactions among species remains poorly understood. It is important to understand species interactions under potential climate change scenarios because those interactions can in turn alter community dynamics. In this study, we conducted two complementary experiments to examine how simulated warming might alter larval intraguild predation (IGP) rates and resulting adult assemblage composition in three species of North American dragonflies: Pachydiplax longipennis, Plathemis lydia and Libellula luctuosa. First, using both P. longipennis and L. luctuosa, we isolated interspecific and intraspecific pairs of larval dragonflies of different size differentials to determine how the size and species identity might influence IGP rates. In tandem, we conducted a year-long mesocosm experiment with all three species to assess how simulated warming and heat waves influenced the resulting adult dragonfly assemblages. IGP trials revealed that P. longipennis individuals were much more likely to engage in IGP than L. luctuosa, regardless of size differential. In the mesocosm experiment, emerging adult assemblages were dominated by P. longipennis individuals, a pattern that was most pronounced in the control treatment. Our results indicate that while P. longipennis may be the competitively dominant species under current ambient conditions, warming may alter this dynamic and lessen the dominance of this species on the resulting assemblage composition.","2022-06","2023-09-26 16:12:27","2023-09-26 16:12:27","","284-295","","3","47","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000723206900001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;93</p>","","","climate change; BIODIVERSITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BODY-SIZE; COMPETITION; CANNIBALISM; FLUCTUATING TEMPERATURES; intraguild predation; INTRAGUILD PREDATION; LARVAL DRAGONFLIES; ODONATA; odonates; RANGE MARGINS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The automatic processing scheme of S1 data was set up for the mapping of open-water flooding (OWF) and flooding under vegetation (FUV). The extremely mild winter of 2019/2020 resulted in several large floods at floodplains that were detected from S1 imagery with a maximal OWF extent up to 5000 ha and maximal FUV extent up to 4500 ha. A significant correlation (r(2) > 0.6) between the OWF extent and the closest gauge data was obtained for inland riverbank floodplains. The outcome enabled us to define the water level at which the water exceeds the shoreline and flooding starts. However, for a coastal river delta floodplain, a lower correlation (r(2) < 0.34) with gauge data was obtained, and the excess of river coastline could not be related to a certain water level. At inland riverbank floodplains, the extent of FUV was three times larger compared to that of OWF. The correlation between the water level and FUV was <0.51, indicating that the river water level at these test sites can be used as a proxy for forest floods.

Recent findings There has been a transient counterbalancing, in which the response to Covid-19 has briefly mitigated pollution and greenhouse gasses. This divergence belies multiple commonalities of cause and effect. The convergence of these two pandemics is unprecedented. Although at first glance, they appear to be completely unrelated, they share striking commonalities. Both are caused by human behaviors, and some of those behaviors contribute to both pandemics at the same time. Both illustrate the fact that isolation is not an option; these are global issues that inescapably affect all persons and all nations. Both incur prodigious current and anticipated costs. Both have similar societal impacts, and disproportionately harm those with lesser resources, widening the gap between the 'haves and the have-nots.' One can only hope that the devastation caused by these unprecedented pandemics will lead to increased awareness of how human beings have helped to create them and how our responses can and will shape our future.","2021-03","2023-09-26 16:12:27","2023-09-26 16:12:27","","66-72","","2","27","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000612726600003","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;34</p>","","","climate change; Covid-19; pandemic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study examined the area burned by wildfires over the entire state of California from the years 2000 to 2020 in order to quantify and identify whether burned area and fire frequency differed across Census tracts according to socioeconomic indicators over time. Wildfire data were obtained from the California Fire and Resource Assessment Program (FRAP) and National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC), while demographic data were obtained from the American Community Survey. Results showed a doubling in the number of Census tracts that experienced major wildfires and a near doubling in the number of people residing in wildfire-impacted Census tracts, mostly due to an over 23,000 acre/year increase in the area burned by wildfires over the last two decades. Census tracts with a higher fire frequency and burned area had lower proportions of minority groups on average. However, when considering Native American populations, a greater proportion resided in highly impacted Census tracts. Such Census tracts also had higher proportions of older residents. In general, high-impact Census tracts tended to have higher proportions of low-income residents and lower proportions of high-income residents, as well as lower median household incomes and home values. These findings are important to policymakers and state agencies as it relates to environmental justice and the allocation of resources before, during, and after wildfires in the state of California.","2021-04","2023-09-26 16:12:27","2023-09-26 16:12:27","","","","8","18","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000644190700001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;15<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;15<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;44</p>","","","climate change; wildfire; VULNERABILITY; AIR-POLLUTION; environmental justice","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ongoing environmental transformations pose many challenges for spatial policy across the entire globe. The aim of this paper is to analyse the effects of climate change on urban spaces in Poland and to answer the question of whether planning practice promotes adaptation to climate change and, if so, to what extent. This paper uses a descriptive and comparative research methodology to interpret planning provisions used in selected local spatial development plans in terms of the arrangements that aim to prevent the negative consequences of climate change. The subject of the analysis is the content of general and detailed plans defined in the texts of the examined resolutions of applicable local plans in the Lower Silesia and Greater Poland voivodeships. This study assessed the validity of applying specific planning provisions. This interpretation was determined on the basis of a review of the current provisions in the Polish law, literature on the subject, as well as the author's own professional experience in the field of spatial planning. The quantitative and qualitative research results are summarized in a table and also examined and described in detail. Examples of planning records that were used in the analysis of local plans are cited and compared.

The green operations have been performed when berry sugar content reached about 14-15.5 degrees Brix. The severe shoot topping at beginning of veraison increased competition of the lateral shoots, contributed to the delay of grapes maturity. Defoliation consisted in removing 30-40% of the vine leaves located above the grape floor (the most active photosynthetically). The results obtained on the qualitative parameters were compared with the control on which no intervention was applied.

Here, we applied multiple machine learning models and their ensemble to explore factors controlling the TL and map its susceptibility at a fine resolution. The models were calibrated and validated using a split-sample approach based on an inventory of TLs from the remote sensing data. The models indicated that summer air temperature and rainfall were the most two important factors controlling the occurrence and distribution of TLs, provided that other geomorphic conditions (i.e., slope, solar radiation, and fine soil) were suitable. The final ensemble susceptibility map based on downscaled climate data and terrain data suggested that ca. 1.4% of the QTP land was classified in high- to very high-susceptibility zone, which is likely to increase in response to future climate change.

A 25-year period natural wildfire database and a wide array of environmental variables are used in this study to develop an artificial neural network model with the aim of predicting potential fire spots. This study focuses on non-human reasons of wildfires (natural) to compute global warming effects on wildfires. Among the environmental variables, this study shows the significance of temperature for predicting wildfire cases while other parameters are presented in a next study. The study area of this study includes all natural forest fire cases in United States from 1992 to 2015. The data of eight days including the day fire occurred and 7 previous days are used as input to the model to forecast fire occurrence probability of that day. The climatic inputs are extracted from ECMWF. The inputs of the model are temperature at 2 meter above surface, relative humidity, total pressure, evaporation, volumetric soil water layer, snow melt, Keetch-Byram drought index, total precipitation, wind speed, and NDVI. The results show there is a transient temperature span for each forest type which acts like a threshold to predict fire occurrence. In temperate forests, a 0.1-degree Celsius increase in temperature relative to 7-day average temperature before a fire occurrence results in prediction model output of greater than 0.8 for 4.75% of fire forest cases. In Boreal forests, the model output for temperature increase of less than 1 degree relative to past 7-day average temperature represents no chance of wildfire. But the non-zero fire forest starts at 2 degrees increase of temperature which ends to 2.62% of fire forest cases with model output of larger than 0.8. It is concluded that other variables except temperature are more determinant to predict wildfires in temperate forests rather than in boreal forests.","2022","2023-09-26 16:12:26","2023-09-26 16:12:26","","193-209","","1","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000746218500013","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;39</p>","","","Climate change; CLIMATE-CHANGE; Temperature; FIRE; Modeling; Wildfires; ZAGROS MOUNTAINS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To tackle this issue, individuals and corporations first need to assess their carbon footprint, which then represents the groundwork for the future implementation of significant changes required to reduce that footprint. We present the carbon emissions attributed to the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) for the year 2019. We partnered with CarbonBuddy and followed their method to break down the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of various activities at CFHT for the entire year of 2019: air travel in and out of state, ground vehicle usage, electricity consumption, and other fossil fuel utilization. The total GHG emissions of CFHT for the year 2019 amount to about 749 tons of CO2 equivalent, which corresponds to more than 16 tons per employee. About 63% of the emissions are related to electricity usage at the summit facility, about 25% to out-of-state travel, about 6% to the use of our fleet of vehicles, and about 5% to electricity usage at headquarters. We show that significant improvements have occurred in the recent past at CFHT, with the installation of solar panels and a remarkable reduction in electricity consumption at headquarters. We list suggestions to further decrease the GHG emissions in the short to long term: offset current emissions by support local projects, invest in more efficient equipment, and establish environmentally friendly habits. The fundamental work presented will facilitate the official planning at CFHT for a drastic reduction in GHG emissions with the goal to meet the objectives laid out in the 2015 Paris Accord. It will also support the design of the Maunakea Spectroscopic Explorer (MSE), the future transformation of CFHT, and allow the project to seize this opportunity and incorporate the fight against climate change as one of its core missions. By choosing to implement those changes, CFHT and MSE can become part of the solution to climate change and lead the way, locally and in the world of astronomy.

The impacts of climate change on aeroallergens such as pollen and fungal spores and allergic respiratory diseases such as allergic asthma and allergic rhinitis have been considered since the early years of climate change and human health research, and exploration of this topic has accelerated over the past decade or so. This review examines the impacts of climate change on aeroallergens, including interactions with air pollutants, and the resulting impacts on allergic respiratory diseases. It discusses mitigation and adaptation in this context. It does this with a focus on advances over the last 2 years (2019 and 2020) to highlight research at the frontier of this field. It also explores the growing recognition of the need for a more holistic and integrated approach to environmental monitoring and exposure and presents the concept of the aeroexposome as a frame through which these impacts of climate change and responses to them could be viewed moving forward. As the evidence of impacts of climate change on aeroallergen production and atmospheric concentration, seasonality, distribution, and allergenicity mounts, crucial research demonstrating the resulting impacts on health outcomes such as aeroallergen sensitisation prevalence, asthma emergency department visits, and asthma hospitalisations is now emerging. It is vital that the momentum of the last decade continue with research to fill the many gaps that remain in our knowledge of this complex topic-refining analytical techniques, broadening the geographical coverage (to include, for example, the Southern Hemisphere), and more explicitly exploring the impacts of climate change on indoor aeroallergens.","2021-03","2023-09-26 16:12:26","2023-09-26 16:12:26","","","","3","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000618781900001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;10<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;10<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;60</p>","","","climate change; IMPACTS; HEALTH; asthma; EXPOSURE; AIR-POLLUTION; CO2; allergen; ALLERGENIC POLLEN; ASTHMA; EXPOSOME; OAK POLLEN; pollen; RAGWEED AMBROSIA-ARTEMISIIFOLIA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An Analysis of Hazards, Policies, and Mobility Patterns","SUSTAINABILITY","","2071-1050","10.3390/su131810235","","The aim of this paper is to develop a typology of displacement in the context of slow-onset environmental degradation linked to climate change (desertification, droughts and increasing temperatures, sea level rise (SLR), loss of biodiversity, land/forest degradation, and glacial retreat). We differentiate regions under environmental threat according to their social vulnerabilities, mobility patterns, and related policies, and identify twelve types of vulnerability/policy/mobility combinations. The paper is based on a synthesis of 321 published case studies on displacement and slow-onset environmental degradation, representing a comprehensive collection of the literature since the 1970s. We observe that vulnerability is especially critical in small island and coastal contexts, as well as in mountainous zones and desert regions. Migration processes are often not visible in areas affected by environmental degradation. When they do occur, they remain mostly internal and oriented towards cities with occasional rural-to-rural migration. Non-mobile people, as well as those who depend on natural resource industries for their livelihoods, are particularly vulnerable to climate change. Persons with lower levels of education are more likely to respond to environmental shock through short-distance migration, whereas highly educated individuals may migrate over longer distances.

We show that from the point of view of the youth activists, the movement powerfully connects personal and local experiences and emotions with climate science. This has enabled the activists to construct an authentic, generational and temporal identity that has helped them to carve out an autonomous position and voice with considerable moral authority among existing climate policy actors. Claiming to represent the future generation, we conclude that activists have offered an important added value to climate science as new ambassadors for scientific consensus and climate mitigation.

The article analyses the narrative developed by the applicants in an Australian case, Sharma by her litigation representative Sister Marie Brigid Arthur v Minister for the Environment [2021] FCA 560 (Sharma 1), in which the ""previously unimaginable power"" to cause potentially ""cataclysmal harm"" to ""Vulnerable Children"" created a duty to those children.

In particular, it reflects on the contribution of the Judeo-Christian tradition to this fault narrative. It focusses in particular on the theology of hope in Christian eschatology, responses to anticipation of catastrophic climate change narratives, and the concept of fault in those narratives.

Climate-dependent tourism markets, such as beach tourism, are particularly sensitive to changes in climate, and understanding the future redistribution of tourism climate resources remains a gap in many world leading tourism regions. This paper presents the first climate change assessment of tourism climate resources in China. The Holiday Climate Index:beach (HCI:beach) and Holiday Climate Index:urban (HCI:urban) are calculated for 775 climate stations across China for the 1981-2010 baseline and mid and late-twenty-first century using projections from six CMIP5 Global Climate Models under low and high emission futures. The projected geographic and seasonal redistribution of tourism climate resources are advantageous for many climate-limited destinations but pose high heat risks for some major city destinations. The differential results for the HCI:beach and HCI:urban reinforce the importance of utilising market-specific indices to assess future climate risk.

We compute the ToEI using probabilistic climate change projections and impact functions from three integrated assessment models of climate change: DICE, RICE and CLIMRISK. Our results demonstrate that, in terms of the business-as-usual carbon emissions scenario, the global economy could reach its ToEI by 2095. Regional results highlight areas that are likely to reach the ToEI sooner, namely Western Europe by 2075, India by 2083, and Africa by 2085. We also explore local-scale variations in the ToEI demonstrating that, for example, Paris already reached the ToEI around 2020, while Shanghai will reach it around 2080. We conclude that the ToEI methodology can be applied to impact models of varying scales when sufficient historical impact data are available. Moreover, unprecedented impacts of climate change in the 21st century may be experienced even in economically developed regions in the US and Europe. Finally, moderate to stringent climate change mitigation policies could delay the extreme economic impacts of climate change by three decades in Latin America, the Middle East, and Japan, by two decades in India, Western Europe, and the US, and by one decade in Africa. Our results can be used by policymakers interested in implementing timely climate policies to prevent potentially large economic shocks due to climate change.","2021-07","2023-09-26 16:12:26","2023-09-26 16:12:26","","","","7","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000670762200001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;37</p>","","","climate change; TEMPERATURE; SCENARIOS; SOCIAL COST; BUSINESS CYCLES; climate risk factors; time of emergence of climate impacts","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper aims at studying the effect of uncertainties in radiative feedbacks and climate system inertia on power spectrum of the global mean surface temperature (GMST) fluctuations. Randomly forced two-box energy balance model (EBM) is used as a main tool of this study. Sensitivity analysis is applied to determine how uncertainties in feedback and climate system inertia affect the power spectrum using the EBM. It was shown that in the high-frequency range of the power spectrum of GMST fluctuations, the influence of climate system inertia is more significant than the influence of feedbacks. In the low-frequency range, on the contrary, the influence of feedbacks on power spectrum exceeds the influence of climate inertia. Our confidence in the results obtained is based on the satisfactory agreement between the theoretical power spectrum derived from the EBM and the power spectrum obtained from observations and coupled climate models, including historical runs of the CMIP5 models.","2021-11","2023-09-26 16:12:26","2023-09-26 16:12:26","","659-668","","6","57","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000736716800013","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;24</p>","","","climate change; VARIABILITY; climate variability; OCEAN; climate system inertia; power spectrum; radiative feedbacks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using panel data econometrics and exploiting both within- and cross-country variations in BMI, we uncovered a robust U-shaped associationbetween temperature and the BMI of girls, boys and women, but failed to detect any significant effect of precipitations. Our analysis also reveals that the impact of temperature on BMI, particularly for girls and women, is robust to the inclusion of other determinants of obesity stressed by the existing literature, such as GDP per capita, fertility, and agriculutral productivity, suggesting that mean air temperature is directly associated with, and may have an independent effect on, BMI.","2021-06","2023-09-26 16:12:26","2023-09-26 16:12:26","","","","","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000663767200019","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;7<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;8<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;105</p>","","","ECONOMIC-GROWTH; Climate change; Temperature; SEX-DIFFERENCES; BMI; BODY-MASS INDEX; DAILY ENERGY-EXPENDITURE; FOOD SYSTEMS; HUMAN HEALTH; LATIN-AMERICA; NUTRITION TRANSITION; Obesity; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; SEASONAL-VARIATION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A reliable model for future climate should reasonably simulate the historical climate. Here, we assess the performance of CMIP6 models in reproducing statistical properties of observed annual maxima of daily precipitation. We go beyond the commonly used methods and assess CMIP6 simulations on three scales by performing: (a) univariate comparison based on L-moments and relative difference measures; (b) bivariate comparison using Kernel densities of mean and L-variation, and of L-skewness and L-kurtosis, and (c) comparison of the entire distribution function using the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution coupled with a novel application of the Anderson-Darling Goodness-of-fit test. The results reveal that the statistical shape properties (related to the frequency and magnitude of extremes) of CMIP6 simulations match well with the observational datasets. The simulated mean and variation differ among the models with 70% of simulations having a difference within +/- 10% from the observations. Biases are observed in the bivariate investigation of mean and variation. Several models perform well with the HadGEM3-GC31-MM model performing well in all three scales when compared to the ground-based Global Precipitation Climatology Centre data. Finally, the study highlights biases of CMIP6 models in simulating extreme precipitation in the Arctic, Tropics, arid and semi-arid regions.","2021-10","2023-09-26 16:12:25","2023-09-26 16:12:25","","","","10","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000711969000012","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;20<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;20<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;89</p>","","","climate change; TEMPERATURE; TRENDS; CMIP6; SIMULATIONS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MODELS; INDEXES; DISTRIBUTIONS; precipitation extremes; DATASETS; PRODUCTS; RUNS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Infants and young children are especially at risk because children are particularly vulnerable to climate-related stressors. The childhood diseases most affected, the breadth and magnitude of future health problems and the time frame over which these problems will manifest remain largely unknown. Objectives: To review the possibility that spacially explicit analyses can be used to determine how climate change has affected children's health to date and whether these analyses can be used for future projections. Methods: As an example of whether these objectives can be achieved, all available Australian environmental and health databases were reviewed. Results: Environmental and health data in Australia have been collected for up to 30 years for the same spatial areas at 'Statistical Area level 1' (SA1) scale. SA1s are defined as having a population of between 200 and 800 people and collectively they cover the whole of Australia without gaps or overlap. Although the SA1 environmental and health data have been collected separately, they can be merged to allow detailed statistical analyses that can determine how climate change has affected the health of children. Conclusions: The availability of environmental and health datasets that share the same precise spatial coordinates provides a pathway whereby past and emerging effects on child health can be measured and predicted into the future.

Mechanisms that determine individuals' willingness to adopt climate-friendly behaviour will be assessed, along with the varying political acceptability of a range of climate change mitigation efforts. The study analyses these factors and mechanisms at three different, but interrelated levels: structural (macro-); individual (micro-); and institutional (meso-level). Micro factors, such as education, age and gender, shape individual preferences. Structural conditions influence a region or country's approach to climate change. For instance, exposure to the detrimental effects of global warming, such as desertification, enhances citizens' awareness of the problem and may encourage societies to make more meaningful efforts to combat climate change. Other structural factors are economic development, income inequality and numerous political economy constraints, such as the fossil fuel dependence of a region. Although structural conditions may constrain climate action, crucial policy design elements, such as compensatory mechanisms can make stringent policies more palatable and improve the public perception of their fairness. Most institutional factors play an intermediary, albeit crucial role in the successful development and implementation of stringent climate policies. An example is the general trust people have in their institutions leading to a deeper societal commitment to solve issues requiring collective action, with climate change representing the most burning and immediate problem demanding a coordinated effort.The analysis specifically examines political regime types and corruption along with different aspects of societal and institutional trust. After presenting prevailing theories on climate awareness, an overview of published empirical works is provided to indicate the 'state of the field' and discuss some open questions and current debates related to different theoretical approaches. By synthetizing a wide range of information from this dynamically evolving field, my objectives are to combine the results of numerous disciplines and provide a comprehensive overview that helps researchers and practitioners become familiar with this crucial area of scientific and policy relevance today, and to facilitate knowledge accumulation on this issue.","2022","2023-09-26 16:12:25","2023-09-26 16:12:25","","86-107","","4","36","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000920486300004","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;109</p>","","","climate politics; POWER; PUBLIC-OPINION; POLICY; WILLINGNESS; RISK PERCEPTION; ENVIRONMENTAL-PROTECTION; TRUST; climate awareness; climate change attitude; CORRUPTION; POLITICAL-ECONOMY; social and regional inequalities; USA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The acoustic characteristics of snapping sound signal were examined to relate to the change in temperature, pH and combination of both parameters Results: Our results showed that there was a significant reduction in the frequency of peak amplitude of snapping sound wave following a two week exposure to a combination of temperature and pH treatments. The frequency of snapping shrimp sound decreased by approximately 30% when exposed to a 2 degrees C increase in temperature and a 0.7 unit decrease in pH, however, elevated temperature alone caused no significant effect on the peak frequency of snapping shrimp sound.

Recently, an increase of rockfall activity has been observed which is probably related to the destabilization of rock slopes through climate-related changes of the mountain cryosphere. This study investigates the rockfall distribution during a 4-year monitoring period by systematic observation with bi-temporal Airborne Laser Scanning DTMs in an area of 610.7 km(2) in the otztal Alps/Tyrol, Austria. The analyses of the 93 detected rockfall events indicate that rockfall activity is highest in proglacial areas. Further 83.9% of all rockfall source areas were mapped in bedrock where the modelled mean annual ground temperature (MAGT) indicates perennial frozen conditions. The results demonstrate the importance of thermal effects on the destabilization of rock faces and show that the triggering of rockfalls is closely related to changes in the glacier and permafrost regime. 18 low-magnitude rockfalls with volumes between 69 +/- 3 m(3) and 8420 +/- 89 m(3) are examined in detail. On the base of the analysis of these events energy line angles of 28.7 degrees for the Fahrboschung and 19.9 degrees for the minimum shadow angle can be derived and significantly longer runout distances on glaciated rockfall paths are observed.","2021-01-02","2023-09-26 16:12:25","2023-09-26 16:12:25","","83-102","","1","103","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000606885700001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;105</p>","","","climate change; QUANTIFICATION; MODELS; PERMAFROST; DAMAGE; LIDAR; Rockfall; runout distance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Faced with these increasing risks, improved information is needed to direct limited resources toward the most cost-effective adaptation actions available. Here we leverage a newly available flood risk dataset for residential properties in the conterminous United States to calculate expected annual damages to residential structures from inland/riverine flooding at a property-level; the cost of property-level adaptations to protect against future flood risk; and the benefits of those adaptation investments assuming both static and changing climate conditions. Our modeling projects that in the absence of adaptation, nationwide damages from riverine flooding will increase by 20%-30% under high levels of warming. Floodproofing, elevation and property acquisition can each be cost-effective adaptations in certain situations, depending on the desired return on investment (i.e. benefit cost ratio), the discount rate, and the assumed rate of climate change. Incorporation of climate change into the benefit-cost calculation increases the number of properties meeting any specified benefit-cost threshold, as today's investments protect against an increasing frequency of future floods. However, because future expected damages are discounted relative to present-day, the adaptation decisions made based on a static climate assumption are very similar to the decisions made when climate change is considered. If the goal is to optimize adaptation decision making, a focus on quantifying present-day flood risk is therefore at least as important as understanding how those risks might change under a warming climate.","2021-09","2023-09-26 16:12:25","2023-09-26 16:12:25","","","","9","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000693209900001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;37</p>","","","climate change; adaptation; flood risk; DAMAGES; MITIGATION BEHAVIOR","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective is to identify how to transform economic and political institutions in order to reduce climate change while maintaining democracy, social justice, and freedom. The study of these institutions reveals that important limits on access to financial resources and planning capacity impedes them to fulfill their mission completely. To understand institutions, the study of their historical, legal, and, in particular, political and social backgrounds is necessary.

Others-e.g., allowing peer-to-peer electricity sales, promoting residential electrification, requiring solar panels on new development, funding microgrids, and paying customers to allow for utility control of electricity use-have received less attention. Here, we explore public perceptions of these understudied policies among California residents (n = 804), a state recognized for innovative energy policy. A majority of respondents supported only one of the policies-requiring solar panels on new development. Others elicited more indecision; few were strongly opposed.

The coincident decrease in slope stability frequently affects infrastructure by creep and subsidence and promotes the generation of rockfalls and rockslides. The increasing hazard posed by warming permafrost rock walls and the growing exposure of infrastructure and individuals create a demand for quantitative monitoring methods. Laboratory-calibrated electrical resistivity tomography provides a sensitive record for frozen versus unfrozen bedrock, presumably being the most accurate quantitative monitoring technique in permafrost areas where boreholes are not available. The data presented here are obtained at the permafrost-affected and unstable Steintaelli Ridge at 3100 m a.s.l. and allow the quantification of permafrost changes in the longest electrical resistivity tomography time series in steep bedrock. Five parallel transects across the rock ridge have been measured five times each, between 2006 and 2019, with similar hardware. Field measurements were calibrated using temperature-resistivity laboratory measurements of water-saturated rock samples from the site. A 3D time-lapse inversion scheme is applied in the boundless electrical resistivity tomography (BERT) software for the inversion of the data. To assess the initial data quality, we compare the effect of data filtering and the robustness of final results with three different filters and two time-lapse models. We quantify the volumetric permafrost distribution in the bedrock and its degradation in the last decades. Our data show mean monthly air temperatures to increase from -3.4 degrees C to -2.6 degrees C between 2005-2009 and 2015-2019, respectively, while simultaneously permafrost volume degraded on average from 6790 m(3) (+/- 640 m(3) rock in phase-transition range) in 2006 to 3880 m(3) (+/- 1000 m(3)) in 2019. For the first time, we provide a quantitative measure of permafrost degradation in unstable bedrock by using a temperature-calibrated 4D electrical resistivity tomography. Our approach represents a fundamental benchmark for the evaluation of climate change effects on bedrock permafrost.","2021-04","2023-09-26 16:12:25","2023-09-26 16:12:25","","241-260","","2","19","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000627250200001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;10<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;10<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;66</p>","","","TEMPERATURE; VARIABILITY; Climate change; CLIMATE-CHANGE; EUROPEAN ALPS; STABILITY; 3D; ERT; Geohazard; CONDUCTIVITY; GEMSSTOCK; INVERSION; MONT-BLANC MASSIF; WARMING PERMAFROST","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To improve how climate change resonates with people, we propose a simple indicator: how many extreme events (hot days and heavy precipitation days) are grandchildren projected to experience that their grandparents will not experience in their lives? We analyse the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 ensemble. During grandchildren's lifetime (2020-2100) under the shared socioeconomic pathway 5-8.5 (SSP5-8.5), in some tropical regions, they are projected to experience >1000 hot days and >5 heavy precipitation days breaking records set in their grandparents' lifetime until 2040. These numbers of unprecedented hot days and heavy precipitation days under SSP5-8.5 are greater in countries with lower CO2 emissions and income per capita than in countries with higher CO2 emissions and income per capita. We show that not only the numbers of unprecedented hot days and heavy precipitation days but also their unevenness across countries can be significantly lowered in the SSP1-2.6 scenario, which is consistent with the 2 degrees C goal of the Paris Agreement. This new approach would help adults easily understand how their climate change mitigation efforts could decrease the unprecedented extreme events during youths' lifetime and reduce the intergenerational and intragenerational inequalities regarding extreme events.","2021-06-01","2023-09-26 16:12:25","2023-09-26 16:12:25","","","","6","3","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000657489200001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;18</p>","","","climate change; CLIMATE; 1.5 DEGREES-C; extreme events; inequality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The findings suggested the health of the population was affected mostly by food insecurity, floods, droughts, and reduced water levels. Studies revealed both morbidity and mortality increased due to climate change, with the most impacted populations being women, children, and the elderly. At greatest risk for impacts from climate change were those from poor and marginal populations, especially impoverished women. The public health sector, healthcare, and potable water sources were some of the least mentioned vulnerability subcategories, indicating more research is needed to better understand their adaptation capacities.

This study investigated the effect of extreme rainfall changes and the risk of floods and landslides under 1.5, 2.0, and 4.0(?)C global warming levels (GWLs). Projections from a large ensemble of pre-CMIP6 models and different warming levels show a remarkable change in heavy precipitation. As a result, with increasing warming this enhances the risk of landslides and flash floods in the context of climate change. Comparisons of vulnerability and change in potential impacts of landslides and floods show that three regions, highly densely populated areas, are the most exposed to landslides and floods. The Southern and Southeastern of Brazil stand out, including metropolitan regions with high economic development and densely populated, which may be those where disasters can intensify both in terms of frequency and magnitude. The eastern portion of the Northeast is also signaled as one of the affected regions due to its high vulnerability and exposure since the present period, although the projections of future climate do not allow conclusive results regarding the intensification of extreme rainfall events in scenarios below 4(?)C. The main metropolitan regions and tourist resorts, and key infrastructure in Brazil are located in those regions.

We applied this modeling framework to analyze potential tradeoffs in planning and operating costs in the power grid due to climate change in the Southeast U.S. in 2050. We find that planning decisions that do not account for climate-induced impacts would result in a substantial increase in social costs associated with loss of load.

An initial step in such a development towards tailored climate information would be to understand the currently available climate indices, their definitions and contexts. This study systematically reviews the scientific literature on climate indices and factors related to specific climate impacts, and in this way identifies currently available climate indices for Swedish forestry and agriculture. The identified indices are analysed relative to climate change impact categories from the vulnerability assessments and adaptation plans set out by the Swedish Forest Agency and the Swedish Board of Agriculture, to indicate development potentials and research gaps in climate indices. The review identifies 79 definitions of climate indices for forestry and 63 indices for agriculture in Sweden. The reviewed literature has employed or developed climate indices for only 11 of the 25 types of climate impact emphasised as important by the two sectoral authorities. Most of the climate indices identified have been adopted for use in modelling forest growth or crop growth and productivity. The results of the review found indices lacking for a substantial number of impacts that are relevant for Swedish forestry and agriculture. The study shows that scientific literature on climate indices to a very limited degree addresses the specific tailoring of climate indices. Potential reasons for the lack of climate indices are discussed, and the study suggests that there is a need to continue climate model development such that the models better represent relevant processes, to advance research on the co-design of indices together with sectoral stakeholders, and to enhance collaboration between adaptation, impact modelling and climatology research. The results of this study may be used in future research to analyse if and how the identified climate indices can be actionable for different stakeholders, and as a foundation to examine the demands and feasibilities of developing new tailored climate indices.","2021","2023-09-26 16:12:24","2023-09-26 16:12:24","","","","","34","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000710062600001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;118</p>","","","Climate services; Climate change adaptation; DECISION-MAKING; ADAPTIVE CAPACITY; Climate indices; Co-design; ECOSYSTEM MODEL ANALYSIS; FAGUS-SYLVATICA; FUTURE CLIMATE; LODGEPOLE PINE; NITROGEN LOSSES; NORTHERN EUROPE; PICEA-ABIES; PINUS-SYLVESTRIS; Tailoring information","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The use of observed temperature relationships for informing changes in hydrologic extremes takes many forms, from simple proportional change approaches to conditioning stochastic rainfall generation on observed temperatures. Although generally focused on understanding changes to precipitation, there is an implied transfer of information gained from precipitation-temperature sensitivities to flooding as extreme precipitation is often responsible for flooding. While reviews of precipitation-temperature sensitivities and the non-stationarity of flooding exist, little attention has been given to the intersection of these two topics. Models which use temperature as a covariate to assess the non-stationarity of extreme precipitation outperform both stationary models and those using a temporal trend as a covariate. But care must be taken when projecting changes in flooding on the basis on precipitation-temperature sensitivities, as antecedent conditions modify the runoff response. Although good agreement is found between peak flow-temperature sensitivities and historical trends across Australia, there remains little evaluation of flood projections using temperature sensitivities globally. Significant work needs to be done before the use of temperature as a covariate for flood projection can be adopted with confidence. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'Intensification of short-duration rainfall extremes and implications for flash flood risks'.","2021-04-19","2023-09-26 16:12:51","2023-09-26 16:12:51","","","","2195","379","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000625179200001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;16<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;16<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;155</p>","","","climate change; SOIL-MOISTURE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FUTURE CHANGES; temperature; FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; flooding; CONVECTIVE PRECIPITATION; HOURLY PRECIPITATION EXTREMES; NON-STATIONARITY; rainfall; RAINFALL EXTREMES; RETURN PERIOD; scaling; SURFACE AIR","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Brazil, sustainable management systems are being proposed to minimize environmental damage by carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and increase soil C and nitrogen (N) stocks under pasture. Simulation models are important tools in the long-term assessment of C and N stock changes in pastures under different management practices. In this study, the Century model, version 4.0, was employed to simulate C and N stocks (0-20 cm layer) as well as forage biomass production in areas of pastures with different ages and different management practices. Carbon and N stocks simulated in the soil organic matter (SOM) equilibrium state under native vegetation were used in the adjustment of the deforestation model and subsequent establishment of pasture. Eight production scenarios for 2050 were simulated in comparison to the current situation depicted by absence of management practices (M), namely: pasture managed without periodic renewal (M1); pasture with chemical control of spontaneous plants (M2); pasture with only initial fertilization (M3); pasture with initial and maintenance fertilization (M4); pasture with initial and maintenance fertilization associated with chemical control of spontaneous plants (M5); silvopastoral system with 30% tree cover (M6); pasture managed with fire (M7); and pasture under intensive management (M8). Simulated scenarios revealed significant increases in C and N stocks, besides similar biomass production. Chemical control of spontaneous plants, initial fertilization at the time of pasture planting, and silvopastoral systems proved to be alternatives to maximize C sequestration. Simulated values of C stocks are strongly related to clay contents (SS2-18.2 t ha(-1), SS3-60.0 t ha(-1) and SS4-29.7 t ha(-1)). Similarly, N stocks also were higher in these areas (SS2-1.7 t ha(-1), SS3-1.8 t ha(-1) and SS4-2.1 t ha(-1)). Additionally, considering different scenarios, forage biomass production is conditioned by adopting management practices, such as control of spontaneous plants and initial fertilization. These results can assist national initiatives associated with management strategies which enhance pasture sustainability in Brazil. Modelling allows supply of information for the gap of data and appoint necessities of studies, especially for the Amazon region where Cerrado-forest transition areas are under strong pressure for agricultural occupation.","2021-12-15","2023-09-26 16:12:51","2023-09-26 16:12:51","","","","","404","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000700886000042","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;139</p>","","","Climate change; MANAGEMENT; GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; CROPPING SYSTEMS; MATTER; TILLAGE; BRAZILIAN AMAZON; CHARCOAL FORMATION; Future scenarios; NITROGEN STOCKS; Pasture management; SILVOPASTORAL SYSTEMS; SOIL ORGANIC-CARBON","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At similar to 30 degrees S in this region, a cool anomaly occurred in the 2000s, between marine heatwaves. Over 2 yr of that anomaly, surveyed reef fishes were 57% temperate, 18% sub-tropical and 25% tropical. The most numerous fishes included a wrasse, herring, bullseye, drummer and damselfish. Based on similarities in the composition of fishes, 7 significant clusters of reefs were identified along a gradation from deep, exposed reefs to shallow, protected lagoonal reefs. Endemic sub-tropical and temperate wrasses and damselfishes typified all reefs. Some of these were ubiquitous over exposed and lagoonal reefs and others prevalent in only one reef type, demonstrating habitat preferences and partitioning among closely related species. This was reflected in the differing order of importance of fishes that typified different reefs. Linear modelling indicated that abiotic (depth, distance from shore) and biotic factors (e.g. algae) explained most of the variation in the fish communities among reefs. Additional variation, particularly within lagoonal reefs, was related to relief, turf and corals, rather than water temperature. Occurrence and reproductive activity of a group of tropical/sub-tropical wrasses and damselfish in some lagoonal reefs with abundant tropical habitats (e.g. corals) suggested that they supported novel communities during cool anomalies. Better predictions of future change and interactions between existing and novel species with environmental cycles requires knowledge of species-specific habitat relationships and biology.","2021-08-19","2023-09-26 16:12:51","2023-09-26 16:12:51","","175-192","","","672","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000691315800013","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;69</p>","","","Climate change; ASSEMBLAGES; CLIMATE; PERFORMANCE; SEA; ABUNDANT; DEMERSAL FISH; INVERTEBRATES; Labridae; LABRIDAE; Pomacentridae; RECRUITMENT; Resource partitioning; SIZE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By the end of the twenty-first century, temperature could rise above 5 degrees C across Vietnam according to the IPCC highest emission pathway scenario. However, research on the temperature-health effects from the geographically diverse sub-tropical northern region of Vietnam is limited making location specific health system preparedness difficult. This study examines the elevated temperature-hospitalization relationship for the seven provinces in northern Vietnam by using generalized linear and distributed lag models. A random-effect meta-analysis was used to estimate the pooled temperature hospitalizations risks for all causes, and for infectious, cardiovascular, and respiratory diseases. The pooled estimates show a significant effect of high temperature on hospitalizations for the same day (lag 0), when a 1 degrees C increase in temperature above 24 degrees C was significantly associated with 1.1% (95% CI, 0.9-1.4%) increased risk for all-cause hospital admissions, 2.4% (95% CI, 1.9-2.9%) increased risk for infectious disease admissions, 0.5% (95% CI, 0.1-0.9%) increased risk for cardiovascular disease admissions, and 1.3% (95% CI, 0.9-1.6%) increased risk for respiratory disease admissions.

It was the coldest Arctic stratospheric winter on record and was characterized by an unusually strong and long-lasting polar vortex. We study the chemical evolution and ozone depletion in the winter 2019/2020 using the global Chemistry and Transport Model ATLAS. We examine whether the chemical processes in 2019/2020 are more characteristic of typical conditions in Antarctic winters or in average Arctic winters. Model runs for the winter 2019/2020 are compared to simulations of the Arctic winters 2004/2005, 2009/2010, and 2010/2011 and of the Antarctic winters 2006 and 2011, to assess differences in chemical evolution in winters with different meteorological conditions. In some respects, the winter 2019/2020 (and also the winter 2010/2011) was a hybrid between Arctic and Antarctic conditions, for example, with respect to the fraction of chlorine deactivation into HCl versus ClONO2, the amount of denitrification, and the importance of the heterogeneous HOCl + HCl reaction for chlorine activation. The pronounced ozone minimum of less than 0.2 ppm at about 450 K potential temperature that was observed in about 20% of the polar vortex area in 2019/2020 was caused by exceptionally long periods in the history of these air masses with low temperatures in sunlight. Based on a simple extrapolation of observed loss rates, only an additional 21-46 h spent below the upper temperature limit for polar stratospheric cloud formation and in sunlight would have been necessary to reduce ozone to near zero values (0.05 ppm) in these parts of the vortex.","2021-09-27","2023-09-26 16:12:51","2023-09-26 16:12:51","","","","18","126","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000702399300022","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;59</p>","","","climate change; TEMPERATURE; SIMULATION; VORTEX; ozone; VALUES; VALIDATION; TRANSPORT; CLONO2; HCL; LAGRANGIAN CHEMISTRY; ozone loss; POLAR OZONE DEPLETION; stratosphere","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, what can this, or should this, mean for a field rooted in traditional business thinking?

Specifically, we advocate both thinking much more widely, in scope and ambition, than we currently do, and simultaneously building our ability to comprehend supply chains in a more nuanced and granular way. We explore whether the bias toward positivist work has omitted potentially interesting findings, and viewpoints. This leads to a call to re-think how we approach our work: should the key criteria always be to focus on theory development or testing? Should academics ""think bigger""? Turning to specific research themes, illustrations of how our current thinking can be challenged or broadened by addressing the circular economy, and role of purchasing and innovation. Specifically, the focus on the PSM function as an intrapreneur within the larger organization, and the role of innovation and technology in PSM work.

We apply network analysis to evaluate the impact of a climate shock-an unprecedented marine heatwave-on patterns of resource use in California fishing communities, which were severely affected through closures of the Dungeness crab fishery. The climate shock significantly modified flows of users between fishery resources during the closures. These modifications were predicted by pre-shock patterns of resource use and were associated with three strategies used by fishing community member vessels to respond to the closures: temporary exit from the food system, spillover of effort from the Dungeness crab fishery into other fisheries, and spatial shifts in where crab were landed. Regional differences in resource use patterns and vessel-level responses highlighted the Dungeness crab fishery as a seasonal ""gilded trap"" for northern California fishing communities. We also detected disparities in climate shock response based on vessel size, with larger vessels more likely to display spatial mobility.

The uncertainty of the estimated ToE is specifically investigated by using three SMILEs to estimate the ICV. The results show that using 1921-40 as a baseline period, the annual mean precipitation ACC is expected to emerge within this century over extratropical regions as well as along the equatorial band. However, ToEs are unlikely to occur, even by the end of this century, over intratropical regions outside of the equatorial band. In contrast, annual mean temperature ACC has already emerged from the temperature ICV for mast of the globe. Similar spatial patterns are observed at the seasonal scale. while a weaker ACC for boreal summer (June-August) precipitation and additional ICV for boreal winter (December-February) temperature translate to later ToEs for some regions. In addition, the uncertainty of ToE related to the choice of a SMII is mostly less than 20 years for annual mean precipitation and temperature. However, it can be as large as 90 years for annual mean precipitation over some regions. Overall, results indicate that the choice of a SMILE is a significant source of uncertainty in the estimation of ToE and results based on only one SMILE should be interpreted with caution.","2021-01","2023-09-26 16:12:51","2023-09-26 16:12:51","","465-478","","2","34","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000615485000002","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;52</p>","","","Climate change; Temperature; Precipitation; Multidecadal variability; Climate variability; Anthropogenic effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using a large ensemble of simulations from a single climate model, we find that tropical TMT trends (1979-2018) vary widely and that a subset of realizations are within the range of satellite observations. Realizations with relatively small tropical TMT trends are accompanied by subdued sea-surface warming in the tropical central and eastern Pacific. Observed changes in sea-surface temperature have a similar pattern, implying that the observed tropical TMT trend has been reduced by multidecadal variability. We also assess the latest generation of GCMs from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). CMIP6 simulations with muted warming over the central and eastern Pacific also show reduced tropical tropospheric warming. We find that 13% of the model realizations have tropical TMT trends within the observed trend range. These simulations are from models with both small and large climate sensitivity values, illustrating that the magnitude of tropical tropospheric warming is not solely a function of climate sensitivity. For global averages, one-quarter of model simulations exhibit TMT trends in accord with observations.

Mortality data from 2007 to 2017 for the three areas were collected from the Sample Vital Registration System, which is a survey of 1 million people. The generalized linear model with Poisson regression link was used to identify associations between mortality and the drought severity and 1-month preceding SPI. Results Only severe and extreme drought in the short-term drought periods affected mortality. Longterm drought was not associated with natural cause mortality in Rangpur and Nilphamari. In Dinajpur, mild and moderate drought was associated with circulatory and respiratory-related mortality. Conclusion The impact of drought on mortality varied by region. This study improves our understanding of how droughts affect specific causes of mortality and will help policy makers to take appropriate measures against drought impacts on selected cause of mortality. Future research will be critical to reduce drought-related risks of health.","2021-08","2023-09-26 16:12:50","2023-09-26 16:12:50","","292-302","","3","64","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000691871400007","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;7<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;8<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;57</p>","","","climate change; TEMPERATURE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RISK; IMPACTS; STRESS; mortality; drought; public health; HUMAN HEALTH; EXTREME EVENTS; INFLAMMATION; METEOROLOGICAL DROUGHT; WILL","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: In this paper, we assessed water supply, demand, and stress under three climate change scenarios in the major countries along the Belt and Road. We ensembled ten Global Climate Model (GCM) runoff data and downscaled it to a finer resolution of 0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees by the random forest model. Results: Our results showed that the GCM runoff was highly correlated with the FAO renewable water resources and thus could be used to estimate water supply. Climate change would increase water supply by 4.85%, 5.18%, 8.16% and water demand by 1.45%, 1.68%, 2.36% under RCP 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5 scenarios by 2050s, respectively. As a result, climate change will, in general, have little impact on water stress in the B&R countries as a whole. However, climate change will make future water resources more unevenly distributed among the B&R countries and regions, exacerbating water stress in some countries, especially in Central Asia and West Asia. Our results are informative for water resource managers and policymakers in the B&R countries to make sustainable water management strategies under future climate change.","2021-10-12","2023-09-26 16:12:50","2023-09-26 16:12:50","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000708468000001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;10<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;10<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;71</p>","","","TEMPERATURE; Climate change; DEMAND; SCARCITY; PRECIPITATION EXTREMES; IRRIGATION; PROJECTED CHANGES; AVAILABILITY; CMIP5 MULTIMODEL ENSEMBLE; Downscaling; Global Climate Model (GCM); GLOBAL EVALUATION; Runoff; SHARED SOCIOECONOMIC PATHWAYS; Water shortage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the 1960s, Bryson was a leader in the wider academic turn toward politically charged interdisciplinarianism. To the dismay of many of his colleagues, he publicly made climatological prognoses in the 1970s, becoming a significant figure in the media landscape. He was not swayed by the arguments for global warming, even as the framing became the recognized face of climate change in the late 1980s. By examining the controversies that Bryson instigated and the currents that he swam against, we can see the wider community crystallizing and promoting positions that may have previously gone unstated. In addition, Bryson's personal contribution to the rise of climate discourse has been underexplored in the historical literature. Bryson was instrumental in bringing climate onto the political radar during the World Food Crisis of 1973, shocking both the US and Canadian political establishments into paying more attention to the issue. Bryson's narrative linking climate change to both food supply and a series of climate anomalies in the 1970s remained predominant in the first World Climate Conference of 1979. Bryson also helped break a seal on climatologists speaking directly to the media, leading to unprecedented climate discourse in the 1970s and giving climate change a springboard to become one of the defining issues of the 21st century.

However, there is a considerable variation among them. Therefore, to understand the different CSA interventions supported and prioritised by the public and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) as well as their impacts at the farmer level, a case study was undertaken in Anantapur district, as it is highly vulnerable to climate change risks due to the increase in temperature, delayed monsoon, erratic rainfall and frequent occurrence of droughts. A case study research method was followed to assess the CSA interventions promoted by Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK), Department of Agriculture, Accion and Adarsha. The findings showed that KVK has prioritised its extension advisory services towards the promotion of field crop (e.g. groundnut)-based CSA. The extension services of NGO-Accion was aimed at promoting horticulture, and Adarsha was prioritised promoting millet-based CSA interventions. Whereas the CSA priority of the department of agriculture was driven by the prevailing zero-budget natural farming project. However, interventions of KVK and NGOs were implemented on a limited scale. Therefore, the recommendations that emerged from the study will help the stakeholders to ensure convergence and foster synergy in implementing CSA interventions at scale. Some challenges faced during the research study were difficulties in the identification of the right stakeholders who were promoting CSA, also their technologies and services related to CSA. However, after a thorough discussion with the extension officers of Anantapur district, the stakeholders were identified and their CSA interventions were ascertained through focus group discussions and secondary data reviewed from magazines and other publications. Furthermore, the present study focused only on the CSA interventions promoted by two public sectors and two NGOs, and there is a wider scope for identifying more stakeholders, e.g. private sector, FPOs and entrepreneurs, and assessing their extent of involvement in the promotion of CSA and prioritisation.","2021-12","2023-09-26 16:12:50","2023-09-26 16:12:50","","3915-3931","","8","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000712439500001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;53</p>","","","climate change; climate-smart agriculture; TECHNOLOGIES; STRATEGY; extension advisory services; prioritisation; stakeholders","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because of difficulties in logistics, studies focusing on deep-sea benthic systems often have limited sample sets that may be far apart in space. Here, we present analyses based on a well-sampled region, the northwest Atlantic, allowing us to relate patterns of polychaete community structure (using taxonomic families and feeding guilds) against well-resolved environmental gradients. We show that community structure is heterogenous in this area. We observe three major groups within polychaete communities which also show differences in feeding guilds. Several environmental gradients, including long-term variables, explained the differences between the groups. Both energetics and habitat structure variables were important, while past fishing intensity had a weak effect, although there was support for a difference in community composition for communities above and below the historical fishing limit of 1200 m. The effect of long-term environmental factors may indicate that the deep sea is not immune to climate change, and these effects must continue to be considered in future management of exploitation of this ecosystem.","2021-05","2023-09-26 16:12:50","2023-09-26 16:12:50","","","","","171","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000647564500002","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;83</p>","","","Climate change; SPECIES RICHNESS; PATTERNS; DEEP-SEA; Diversity; Fishing; FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY; HIGHER TAXA; LONG-TERM CHANGE; MACROBENTHIC COMMUNITIES; Macrofauna; NORTHWEST ATLANTIC; Polychaeta; SANDY BOTTOM ECOSYSTEM; TAXONOMIC DISCRIMINATION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it is not clear to what degree urbanization impacts climate change. In the study, station pairs were created by selecting 42 stations that recorded data between 1970-2018 to reflect the climate characteristics seen in Turkey.The changes of the selected climate indices in these station pairs in the hot (April-September) and cold (October-March) periods were examined by taking into account the observations covering the years 1970-2018. This study utilized the RClimDex program and Mann Kendall trend analysis technique. The RClimDex program was used to generate 27 climate indices. The information derived from the indices not only demonstrates how the mean value changes over time, rather, it; also contains information about how the statistical distribution of the data has changed. In addition, the results provide crucial information about the trends of extremes. In the study, 4 indices related to temperature (Diurnal Temperature Range, Cool Nights, Warm Nights, Minimum of Minimum) were selected and examined. When the changes in the climate indices of the selected stations in the hot and cold periods are examined, it is observed that the change in the hot period is more pronounced than the change in the cold period. According to Mann Kendall trend analysis, most of the trends are statistically significant at the 95% level in all station pairs examined. Results of the trend analysis show that the fastest tendency to increase occur in stations located in the Black Sea, Aegean and Mediterranean coastal zones where the moisture content in the air is higher. This finding points to the positive feedback mechanism created by the increased moisture content in atmosphere through global climate change.","2022","2023-09-26 16:12:50","2023-09-26 16:12:50","","69-83","","45","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000961342500005","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;48</p>","","","VARIABILITY; EUROPE; CIRCULATION; Climate Change; SURFACE; Turkey; INDEXES; AIR-TEMPERATURE; Climate Indices; Extreme Temperature; GREECE; Mann-Kendall; MAXIMUM; MINIMUM; Trend; TREND ANALYSIS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These changes affect erosion and sediment redistribution processes that are vital to our understanding of terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems and sediment input to oceans. This 79 day study of the Orwell Glacier meltwater stream on Signy Island (5 December 2019-21 February 2020) used 5 min recordings of turbidity, stream discharge (Q) and air temperature (AT), supplemented by 454 water samples from which suspended sediment concentration (SSC) was gravimetrically determined, to calculate daily suspended sediment loads (SSLs). Q(mean) was 47.8 +/- 3.5 l s(-1), SSCmean was 71.0 +/- 15.9 mg l(-1) and daily SSLmean was 75 +/- 8 kg day(-1) with a suspended sediment yield of 43.6 t km(-2) yr(-1). A multiple regression model predicted SSLs reliably (multiple r = 0.95, r(2) = 0.91, n = 79) and, when run with AT(mean) + 1 degrees C (expected on Signy Island by 2060) and AT(mean) + 2 degrees C (expected by 2100) scenarios, the model predicted 7% and 13% increases in SSLs, respectively. The SSLs estimated in this study are low when compared with others from around the world.","2021-04","2023-09-26 16:12:50","2023-09-26 16:12:50","","192-212","","2","33","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000648921000008","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;59</p>","","","climate change; TEMPERATURE; VARIABILITY; VEGETATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RIVER; CATCHMENT; ZONE; PENINSULA; ACTIVE LAYER; DISCHARGE HYSTERESIS PATTERNS; glacial hydrology; sediment load","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These ensembles are a result of combining Monte Carlo projections from a human-Earth system model of intermediate complexity with pattern-scaled responses from climate models of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). These future ensemble scenarios consider a range of global actions to abate emissions through the twenty-first century. We evaluate distributions of surface-air temperature and precipitation change over three sub-national regions: western, central, and eastern South Africa. In all regions, we find that without any emissions or climate targets in place, there is a greater than 50% likelihood that mid-century temperatures will increase threefold over the current climate's two-standard deviation range of variability. However, scenarios that consider more aggressive climate targets all but eliminate the risk of these salient temperature increases. A preponderance of risk toward decreased precipitation (3 to 4 times higher than increased) exists for western and central South Africa. Strong climate targets abate evolving regional hydroclimatic risks. Under a target to limit global climate warming to 1.5 degrees C by 2100, the risk of precipitation changes within South Africa toward the end of this century (2065-2074) is commensurate to the risk during the 2030s without any global climate target. Thus, these regional hydroclimate risks over South Africa could be delayed by 30 years and, in doing so, provide invaluable lead-time for national efforts to prepare, fortify, and/or adapt.","2021-10","2023-09-26 16:12:50","2023-09-26 16:12:50","","","","3-4","168","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000711876200003","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;27</p>","","","Climate change; CLIMATE-CHANGE; Temperature; Precipitation; Mitigation; SURFACE AIR-TEMPERATURE; PATTERN; Risk","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This legislation sought to curb particular forms of protest in the name of protecting public order. These legislative responses are illustrative of how the Australian economy's reliance on fossil fuel extraction is protected from critique. We show how the contestation of resource extraction is escalated by politicians to the level of a threat to the nation.

By means of a QGIS Plug-in a sensitivity analysis to the predisposition factors used in the construction of models of susceptibility to wildfires in Madeira Island was performed. For this analysis the burnt areas from 2006 to 2013 were related with some widely used variables in wildfire susceptibility modelling, namely land use, elevation, slopes, precipitation, humidity and temperature. The overall performance achieved by the information value method was assessed through success rate curves. The susceptibility models obtained with different combinations of variables present a very similar and unsatisfactory explanatory capacity. The different variable combination provided by the analysis demonstrated that land use and elevation play a major role in wildfire susceptibility explanatory capacity in Madeira Island. Additionally, the development of the QGIS Plug-in allowed to obtain quick and reliable results, proving to be extremely useful in the sensitivity analyses performed.","2021","2023-09-26 16:12:50","2023-09-26 16:12:50","","5-23","","28","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000757017400002","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;28</p>","","","climate change; wildfire; HAZARD; IGNITION RISK; Madeira Island; susceptibility","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The experts proved that a core catalyst which bootstrapped the climate changes was greenhouse gas emission. This has led to a range of social, economic, and ecological issues. Such issues could be solved by extending innovation and information technology. This paper aimed to check the hypothesis that innovation and information technology allowed for a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The author used such methodology as OLS, fully modified OLS (FMOLS), dynamic OLS (DMOLS), Dicky-Fuller and Phillips-Perron tests. The research is informed by the report of the World Economic Forum, World Data Bank, Eurostat for the Visegrad countries (Hungary, Poland, Check Republic, Slovakia) for the period of 2000-2019. The findings were confirmed in models without control variables, and an increase of 1% of patents led to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 0.28% for Poland, 0.28% for Hungary, 0.38% for the Slovak Republic and 0.46% for the Czech Republic. At the same time, for the models with control variables, only Hungary experienced a statistically significant impact. There, an increase of patents by 1% led to reduction of GHG emissions by 0.22%. The variable R&D expenditure was statistically significant for all countries and all types of models (with and without control variables). The increase of R&D expenditure provoked a decline of GHG emissions by 0.29% (without control variables) and 0.11% (with control variables) for Poland, by 0.26% (without control variables) and 0.41% (with control variables) for Hungary, by 0.3% (without control variables) and 0.23% (with control variables) for the Slovak Republic and by 0.54% (without control variables) and 0.38% (with control variables) for the Czech Republic.","2021-02","2023-09-26 16:12:49","2023-09-26 16:12:49","","","","2","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000622681600001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;34<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;34<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;41</p>","","","climate change; emission; carbon dioxide; Internet","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As the characteristics of wildfires change, it is critical to understand where emerging risks for human and natural systems are most profound. We assess how future wildfire potential, defined here as the meteorological conditions and the availability of burnable vegetation types conducive to wildfire occurrence, are projected to change in the future. To achieve this, we combine modelled temperature and precipitation to calculate the Keetch-Byram Drought Index (KBDI) as a proxy for soil moisture deficit and overlay a weighting factor representing burnable vegetation derived from land cover classifications. Through our analysis of daily data at both mid- and end-of-century, we find that climate-related changes, such as increasing temperatures and drying patterns, will elevate wildfire potential globally, both in terms of severity of maximum daily KBDI and frequency of high KBDI days. We find that regions which have recently endured major fire events, including the western United States, Australia, and the Amazon, could experience increases in maximum KBDI of up to 100 in places, with more than 60 additional days of high KBDI by mid-century, compared to the historical baseline. Additionally, at the end-of-the-century, regions across much of Africa, Central America, and Southern Asia are projected to emerge as wildfire hotspots. While the occurrence of wildfires may still be rare today in many regions, we find that climatological trends are projected to increase wildfire potential for much of the globe, creating new risks for some, and raising the challenge for already wildfire-prone communities to effectively manage forests and protect people and critical resources.","2021-03-01","2023-09-26 16:12:49","2023-09-26 16:12:49","","","","3","3","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000638142900001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;15<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;15<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;73</p>","","","climate change; RISK; PROJECTIONS; wildfire; MANAGEMENT; INCREASE; PREDICTION; UNITED-STATES; BURNED AREA; FIRE DANGER; KBDI; land cover; MOISTURE; SATELLITE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Temperatures deviating from this optimum can affect nestling growth and fledging success with potential consequences on survival and lifetime reproductive success. It is therefore particularly important to understand these effects in relation to projected temperature changes associated with climate change. Targets set by the 2015 Paris Agreement aim to limit temperature increases to 2 degrees C, and, with this in mind, we carried out an experiment in 2017 and 2018 where we applied a treatment that increased Great Tit Parus major nest temperature by approximately this magnitude (achieving an increase of 1.6 degrees C, relative to the control) during the period from hatching to fledging to estimate how small temperature differences might affect nestling body size and weight at fledging and fledging success. We recorded hatching and fledging success and measured skeletal size (tarsus length) and body mass at days 5, 7, 10, and 15 posthatch in nestlings from two groups of nest boxes: control and heated (+1.6 degrees C). Our results show that nestlings in heated nest boxes were 1.6% smaller in skeletal size at fledging than those in the cooler control nests, indicating lower growth rates in heated boxes, and that their weight was, in addition, 3.3% lower. These results suggest that even fairly small changes in temperature can influence phenotype and postfledging survival in cavity-nesting birds. This has the potential to affect the population dynamics of these birds in the face of ongoing climatic change, as individuals of reduced size in colder winters may suffer from decreased fitness.","2021-06","2023-09-26 16:12:49","2023-09-26 16:12:49","","7346-7353","","12","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000645929500001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;9<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;9<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;47</p>","","","climate change; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RESPONSES; STRESS; TRAITS; ORIENTATION; BODY SIZE; INCUBATION-TEMPERATURE; juvenile development; NESTBOXES; OFFSPRING QUALITY; POSTFLEDGING SURVIVAL; reproductive success","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These changes are exacerbating socioeconomic difficulties faced by many mountain communities, and are already intensifying vulnerabilities across mountain areas globally. The situation is indicative of pervasive and consequential deficits in adaptation, and calls attention to the need for a better understanding of existing adaptation efforts, as well as the prospects for increasing the quantity and quality of adaptation action in mountain regions. In response, this MountainAgenda article introduces a conceptual framework for adaptation gaps. It then uses data from 2 major global-scale adaptation reviews to shed light on the nature and true magnitude of the adaptation gap in mountains. It reveals shortcomings in available adaptation options, deficits in the uptake of existing adaptation support, and a general lack of coherence between existing adaptations and keystone global agreements relevant to climate change adaptation. These shortcomings are largely related to soft limits to adaptation that constrain responses across mountain areas. In this article, we provide recommendations for closing the adaptation gap in mountains and suggest that this will require deeply collaborative efforts that are rooted in local needs, aspirations, and ways of knowing, but that are also supported by external capacity building and implementation resources. In many instances, this will resemble a transformative approach to adaptation. The conceptual framework presented here is broadly applicable and can also be utilized to identify and close adaptation gaps in social-ecological contexts beyond mountains.","2021-08","2023-09-26 16:12:49","2023-09-26 16:12:49","","A1-A10","","3","41","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000730799800010","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;78</p>","","","climate change; VARIABILITY; IMPACTS; KNOWLEDGE; RESILIENCE; VULNERABILITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE ADAPTATION; adaptation; BARRIERS; POLITICS; GLACIER; gaps; limits; mountains; PREPARE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, health is reported to be less active in climate adaptation than other sectors. To contribute to better understanding urban health adaptation efforts and identifying gaps we developed a City Climate Health Adaptation Typology and tested it with adaptation actions of 106 large world cities (population > 1 million) reported to a major publiclyavailable adaptation database. We found two-thirds of actions of these ?active adapter? cities were healthassociated. Half were health information activities (e.g., hazard mapping, early warnings); and nearly onethird addressed climate-relevant health determinants in the urban built environment (e.g., green space). Forty percent of cities were in low- or middle-income countries. Our proposed typology provides a systematic framework for monitoring and comparing city health adaptation actions. Reported city actions are suggestive of increasing depth and breadth of urban health-associated adaptation. However, even among these adaptationengaged cities, a health adaptation gap was apparent in key climate health services (e.g., mental health), and in climate-related public health governance and capacity building. The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated pressing need for strong public health institutions. We recommend better integration of public health agencies into local climate action planning, enhanced modes of collaboration between health and non-health agencies and with non-governmental actors, and strengthening of city public health adaptive capacity including through networking.","2021-05","2023-09-26 16:12:49","2023-09-26 16:12:49","","","","","196","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000649615200003","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;64</p>","","","Climate change; Adaptation; POLICY; Public health; GOVERNANCE; Cities","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Habitat specialists, range-restricted species and species with limited dispersal abilities may be unable to track changing conditions, increasing their extinction risk. In response to changing conditions and species movement patterns, there is a need to account for the effects of climate change when designing protected areas and identifying potential climate refugia. We used ecological niche models projected into future climates to identify potential impacts of climate change on the distribution of 11 rupicolous reptile species in the Soutpansberg Mountains, South Africa. Lygodactylus incognitus, Lygodactylus soutpansbergensis, Platysaurus relictus and Vhembelacerta rupicola were identified as being vulnerable to climate change due to substantial reductions in suitable habitat and low spatial overlap between current and future niche envelopes. We identified areas of high conservation importance for the persistence of these species under present-day and projected future conditions. The western Soutpansberg was identified as an area of high conservation priority as it is a potential refuge under future projections. Projecting distributions of vulnerable species into future climate predictions can guide future research and identify potential refugia that will best conserve species with restricted ranges in a world with climate change.","2021-12","2023-09-26 16:12:49","2023-09-26 16:12:49","","264-273","","4","48","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000721003600006","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;70</p>","","","ADAPTATION; climate change; RESPONSES; IMPACTS; MODELS; FUTURE; PREDICTION; SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS; biodiversity; conservation; Maxent; refugia; BIAS; HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; NICHES","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The applicability of passive design strategies is influenced by the comprehensive effect of outdoor meteorological conditions and indoor thermal comfort criteria. The paper focuses on the analysis of recorded climate change during the period between 1970 and 2017 for 1019 meteorological stations in China. The object was to analyze the observed change between two periods (1970?1993 and 1994?2017) in relation to the change in the applicability of four selected passive building design strategies, namely passive solar heating, natural ventilation, thermal mass with or without night ventilation and direct evaporative cooling. The methodology consists of raw data processing, TMY derivation, bioclimatic analysis and spatial results representation using ArcGIS.

One issue when it comes to measuring, for example, impacts, vulnerabilities, and resilience in preparation of adaptation action is the abundance of conceptual frameworks and associated definitions. Frequently, those definitions contradict each other and shift over time. Prominently, in the transition from the IPCC AR (International Panel on Climate Change Assessment Report) 4 to the IPCC AR 5, a number of conceptual understandings have changed. By integrating common concepts, the literature review presented intends to thoroughly investigate frameworks applied to assess climate change effects on urban areas, creating an evidence base for research and politically relevant adaptation. Thereby, questions concerning the temporal development of publication activity, the geographical scopes of studies and authors, and the dominant concepts as applied in the studies are addressed. A total of 50 publications is identified following screening titles, abstracts, and full texts successively based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Major findings derived from our literature corpus include a recently rising trend in the number of publications, a focus on Chinese cities, an imbalance in favor of authors from Europe and North America, a dominance of the concept of vulnerability, and a strong influence of the IPCC publications. However, confusion regarding various understandings remains. Future research should focus on mainstreaming and unifying conceptual frameworks and definitions as well as on conducting comparative studies.","2021-10","2023-09-26 16:12:49","2023-09-26 16:12:49","","","","19","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000708167300001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;81</p>","","","AFRICA; TRENDS; CHANGE IMPACTS; MANAGEMENT; CHANGE ADAPTATION; climate change adaptation; CITIES; VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT; URBANIZATION; BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS; DESIGN; systematic literature review; urban climate; vulnerability assessment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Binary logit models were applied on data of 386 farmers, collected from three different agro-ecological zones of Punjab, Pakistan, to present a comprehensive analysis of different adaptation strategies missing in the existing literature. The coefficients of a binary logit model only explain the direction of change; therefore, to see the magnitude of change, marginal effects were also estimated. Findings revealed that farmers perceived climate change and opted different adaptation strategies. Results of binary logit models described age, education, farming experience, landholding, access to climate information, access to credit facilities, and access to extension services as important determinants of adaptation. This research also found lack of access to climate information, lack of irrigation resources, and knowledge about appropriate adaptations as key constraints in adaptation process. This situation can be improved by enhancing institutional support and capacity. It is suggested that improved agricultural education with better access to climate information and extension services affects the farmers' well-being directly and hence is good for the economy of Pakistan.","2021-03","2023-09-26 16:12:48","2023-09-26 16:12:48","","14844-14853","","12","28","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000687505700001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;9<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;9<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;46</p>","","","Agriculture; VARIABILITY; SOIL; Climate change; DETERMINANTS; Adaptation; STRATEGIES; Pakistan; MITIGATION; AGRICULTURE; ADOPTION; LEVEL ADAPTATION; Perception; SUBSISTENCE FARMERS; WATER CONSERVATION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Little is known about medical doctors' (MDs) attitude towards climate protection measures in outpatient practices. Methods: Between October 2020 and February 2021, a survey was conducted among MDs in German practices. 1,683 participants answered 39 questions on energy use, transportation, disposable materials, budget and patient counselling. Data were collected on status, motivation, obstacles and needs regarding climate protection in practices. Results: 83% considered climate change an urgent problem requiring immediate action. A majority reported climate effects on their patients' health. Most MDs felt responsible for climate protection in their practices, showing a high degree of willingness to implement climate-friendly measures. Obstacles reported include lack of information and institutional support as well as the expected financial burden. A majority of MDs called on professional associations and politics to develop climate-friendly strategies. Conclusion: In view of national climate targets and the willingness of outpatient MDs to contribute to climate protection, support from medical associations is required, e. g. through practical recommendations and financial help, in order to transform the health sector in accordance with the idea of Planetary Health. Accompanying studies should provide further evidence on effective measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in practices.","2021-11","2023-09-26 16:12:48","2023-09-26 16:12:48","","44-54","","","166","","","","","","","","","","German","","","","WOS:000744533400006","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;32</p>","","","PLANETARY HEALTH; Germany; Climate change and health; Climate protection; Divestment; Outpatient care","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We explore this possibility by introducing a population policy aiming at imposing a cap on population growth into an extended global integrated assessment model of climateeconomy with endogenous fertility choices and temperature-related mortality. We show that the social costs of environmental policies, as reflected by both the social cost of carbon and social welfare, substantially increase by accounting for endogenous population change, but demographic policy allows to significantly reduce such costs. This clearly suggests that population growth does matter and so population policy may represent an effective mitigation tool to complement standard climate policies.","2021-06","2023-09-26 16:12:48","2023-09-26 16:12:48","","","","","184","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000636442900011","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;10<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;10<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;58</p>","","","FUTURE; Climate Change; POLICY; SOCIAL COST; Population Growth; Population Policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Farmers are both the basic executors of agricultural adaptation and among the most vulnerable groups to climate change. However, the understanding on climate change perception and adaptive behavior of local farmers is still very limited. This study develops a binary logistic regression (BLR) model to explore the underlying principles of local farmer's perception and adaptive behavior toward climate change, with a focus on influential farmers. Through a field survey with 117 head farmers from 89 farmers' cooperatives in Chongming Island of China the largest alluvial island in the world, we found that: 1) 92% of the respondents thought climate change is happening; 59% of the respondents thought climate change has an obvious impact on agriculture production; and 45% of the respondents had a plan for future adaptation. 2) Based on BLR analysis, it was found that 3 out of 16 factors have significant impacts on head farmer's adaptive behavior toward climate change, including agricultural training, perceived temperature change, and education level. 3) The percentage of consistency (POC) is proposed to describe the performance of our BLR model. The overall POC of BLR model is 68.4%, with a higher POC (85.7%) for farmers who have no adaptive behavior. 4) Key measures to enhance local climate adaptation include an integrated and coordinated plan of farmer-level adaptation, tailored and specialized training programs, improvement of scientific research, and publicity of best practices.

A massive river basin named Cauvery with 35 observation stations is categorized into three subbasin to study the regional climate impacts. In this case, the PCR model performed remarkably well compared to other conventional machine learning models with half the computational time than usual. The test statistics state that the validation of the proposed model illustrates a variance in calibration results of the PCR model, which is ranged between 2 and 5%, and a variance in validation, which is less than 7% throughout the study area. Since it is desired to prioritize GCMs to choose the merely suitable models for a strategic climate study, the models were selected based on the PCR model performance.

Using multiple empirical approaches and two decades of sales data covering the universe of homes in the United States, we find little evidence that housing markets fully price information about flood risk in aggregate. However, the price penalty is larger for commercial buyers and in markets where buyers are more risk aware, suggesting that policies to improve risk communication could influence market outcomes. Our findings indicate that houses in flood zones in the United States are currently overvalued by a total of $43.8 billion (95% confidence interval: $32.6 to $55.6 billion) based on the information in publicly available flood hazard maps alone, raising concerns about the stability of real estate markets as climate risks become more salient and severe.","2021-04-27","2023-09-26 16:12:48","2023-09-26 16:12:48","","","","17","118","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000645031000014","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;12<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;12<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;33</p>","","","climate change; DISASTER; flood risk; FLOOD; real estate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During the last decades it has been threatened by accelerating erosion with negative consequences for the environment and the economy. The aim of the current study was to assess soil loss changes in a typical Mediterranean ecosystem of Northern Greece, under climate change. To this end, freely available geospatial data was collected and processed using open-source software package. The widespread RUSLE empirical erosion model was applied to estimate soil loss. Current and future rainfall erosivity were derived from a national scale study considering average weather conditions and RCMs outputs for the medium Representative Concentration Pathway scenario (RCP4.5). Results showed that average rainfall erosivity (R-Factor) was 508.85 MJ mm ha h(-1) y(-1) while the K-factor ranged from 0.0008 to 0.05 t ha h ha(-1) MJ(-1) mm(-1) and LS-factor reached 60.51. Respectively, C-factor ranged from 0.01 to 0.91 and P-factor ranged from 0.42 to 1. The estimated potential soil loss rates will remain stable for the near future period (2021-2050), while an increase of approximately 9% is expected by the end of the 21th century (2071-2100). The results suggest that appropriate erosion mitigation strategies should be applied to reduce erosion risk. Subsequently, appropriate mitigation measures per Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) categories are proposed. It is worth noting that the proposed methodology has a high degree of transferability as it is based on open-source data.","2021-08","2023-09-26 16:12:48","2023-09-26 16:12:48","","","","15","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000682198200001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;18<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;18<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;116</p>","","","climate change; MODEL; SIMULATION; erosion; CHANGE IMPACTS; RATES; CLIMATE-CHANGE PROJECTIONS; ERODIBILITY; LANDSCAPE; LS-FACTOR; RUSLE; SEDIMENT TRANSPORT; soil loss","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study examines differences for Canada and six sub-regions between simulations from the latest Sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) and its predecessor CMIP5. Ensembles from both experiments are assessed using a set of derived indices calculated from daily precipitation and temperature, with projections compared at fixed future time intervals and fixed levels of global temperature change. For changes calculated at fixed time intervals most temperature indices display higher projected changes in CMIP6 than CMIP5 for most sub-regions, while greater precipitation changes in CMIP6 occur mainly in extreme precipitation indices. When future projections are calculated at fixed levels of global average temperature increase, the size and spread of differences for future projected changes between CMIP6 and CMIP5 are substantially reduced for most indices. Temperature scaling behaviour, or the regional response to increasing global temperatures, is similar in both ensembles, with annual temperature anomalies for Canada and its sub-regions increasing at between 1.5 and 2.5 times the rate of increase globally, depending on the region. The CMIP6 ensemble projections exhibit modestly stronger scaling behaviour for temperature anomalies in northern Canada, as well as for certain indices of moderate and extreme events. Such temperature scaling differences persist even if anomalously warm CMIP6 global climate models are omitted. Comparing the mean and variance of future projections for Canada in CMIP5 and CMIP6 simulations from the same modelling centre suggests CMIP6 models are significantly warmer in Canada than CMIP5 models at the same level of forcing, with some evidence that internal temperature variability in CMIP6 is reduced compared with CMIP5.","2021-10-20","2023-09-26 16:12:47","2023-09-26 16:12:47","","269-284","","4-5","59","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000731186500006","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;7<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;7<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;27</p>","","","CMIP6; EXTREMES; PRECIPITATION; DAILY TEMPERATURE; Canada climate change; model ensembles","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on temperature and rainfall data, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) dataset, and district statistical data, we investigated the spatiotemporal variations of temperature, rainfall, urban land, and VCC in all the urban and suburban areas of Bangladesh during 1990-2018. To quantify the impact of urbanization on VCC, two regression models were built between growing-season NDVI (GNDVI) and proportion of urban land (PUL). Linear regression, Pearson's correlation, and Spearman correlation analysis were carried out to identify the temporal correlation among the variables. Results show that the rainfall, temperature, GNDVI, and PUL varied greatly among the districts. The inter-annual GNDVI was found to be closely related to diverse climatic variables, while the inter-annual GNDVI was moderately sensitive to climatic changes. A significant correlation was found between the trend of GNDVI and GP, while a negative correlation between the GNDVI trend and GT, GNDVI and PUL change. The strong sensitivity of GNDVI change to GP was calculated in the precipitation range of 2200-3000 mm and GNDVI to GT change in the temperature range of 300-31 degrees C. Besides, urban expansion was found mostly responsible for VCC in the study area. Unplanned urban developments would persist and accelerate diverse environmental changes and unsustainability. The findings of the study warn us about the need for sustainable landscape management and ecological preservation.","2021-11","2023-09-26 16:12:47","2023-09-26 16:12:47","","","","","24","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000719664700001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;7<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;7<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;52</p>","","","Climate change; CLIMATE-CHANGE; IMPACTS; NDVI; WATER; CITY; Bangladesh; ECOLOGY; INTERPOLATION; RESERVOIR; Urban expansion; URBAN VEGETATION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Effects of pollutants on adults receive less attention, although vulnerabilities can be expected throughout the entire life span in young, middle-aged and old individuals. We use the animal model Caenorhabditis elegans to systematically quantify neurological outcomes by application of an age-resolved method. Adult hermaphrodite worms were exposed to pollutants or non-chemical stressors such as temperature in liquid culture on microtiter plates and locomotion fitness was analyzed in a whole-life approach. Cultivation at 15, 20 or 25 degrees C showed that worms held at 15 degrees C displayed an enhanced level of fitness concerning swimming movements until middle age (11-days-old) and then a decline.

Here, we provide a step-by-step protocol to investigate the health span of adult C. elegans that may serve as a platform for automation and data collection.

Planetary boundaries examine environmental issues and climate change in a social context. Unlike radical ecology movements, this approach does not examine the current social, political, and economic structure against the ontology of green nature. The planetary boundaries uses the doughnut scheme and suggests that 11 social problems can be solved if nine ecological risks are brought within safe zones. This framework was first introduced in 2009 and further developed in 2015 and 2019. According to the planetary boundaries concept, not all ecosystems face the same level of risk, and environmental issues need to be categorized and analyzed quantitatively. For example, while the limit of carbon dioxide emissions had been 350 ppm, it has currently reached 412 ppm. The safe zone, also called the ecological ceiling, has been exceeded. Another category is biodiversity loss. While the limit for biodiversity loss had been 10%, it has currently reached over 16%. Recent studies have shown the ecological ceilings to have also been exceeded with regard to the nitrogen and phosphorus cycles, land cover changes, and deforestation. The global ecological ceilings for ozone depletion, ocean acidification, and freshwater consumption have not yet been exceeded, but the level of risk is increasing.","2022","2023-09-26 16:12:47","2023-09-26 16:12:47","","85-95","","45","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000961342500006","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;59</p>","","","climate change; CLIMATE-CHANGE; IMPACTS; ANTHROPOCENE; Ecological crisis; planetary boundaries","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study evaluated the perceptions of smallholder cocoa farmers on climate change manifestations and adaptations in the Adansi South District, Ghana. The study involved a survey of 150 households and three focus group discussions from three communities in the district. The Mann-Kendall trend test was used to evaluate the rainfall and temperature trends for the period 1981-2019. The weighted average index (WAI) was used to determine the farmers' perception of climate change, its physical manifestation on their cocoa farms, and adaptation practices. While the district's temperature varied consider-ably from 1981 to 2019, only a marginal increase in annual rainfall was observed. The farmers correctly perceived the changes in climate (WAI = 2.07), evidenced by changes in rainfall patterns (1.76), frequent bushfires (1.68), and increasing intensity of the sun (1.65). Physical manifestations of these changes included increased dieback of cocoa trees (1.77), diseases and pest infestation (1.75), decreased yields (1.69), and stunted growth (1.65). Adaptation measures included early planting of cocoa seeds (1.87), intercropping (1.70), mulching (1.65), planting of drought-resistant varieties (1.64), and crop diversification (1.63). The adaptation measures were influenced by gender, age, education, and farming experience, among other socioeconomic factors. The findings suggest the need for relevant policies to educate cocoa farmers on the effects of climate change, highlighting the risks and benefits, and prioritizing key adaptation options for sustainable cocoa pro-duction in Ghana.","2022","2023-09-26 16:12:47","2023-09-26 16:12:47","","","","","4","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000903672900001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;62</p>","","","SOIL; Climate change; IMPACT; FOREST; Adaptation; CONSERVATION; SYSTEMS; DIVERSIFICATION; Cocoa production; Ghana","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This linkage has captured the collective imagination, with forced mobility representing one of the most perceptible societal impacts of climate change and environmental hazards. Through in-depth interviews with subject-matter experts related to the Asia Pacific region, this paper explores the terminological uncertainty evident when conceptualising and addressing the issues associated with human mobility, climate change and the associated increased risk of environmental hazards. Shaped through the complexity of socio-ecological systems and often-intertwined causal drivers of migration, this uncertainty reveals a major policy gap in the nexus between human mobility and climate change on multiple scales. The findings from this study explore the ways in which these terms act to conceal global accountabilities and draw boundaries around 'acceptable' forms of mobility.

The global warming targets (D1.5,D2.0,D2.5) are attained by the 2024, 2040 and 2056 under the RCP4.5 scenario, on the other hand, the respectively, attained years for Iran are 2023, 2036 and 2051, an evidence of a higher mean increase in surface air temperature respect to the global behavior. We identified important aspects regarding to temperature anomalies in the Iran region: (1) A mean warming of 1.0 celcius for the 2001-2010 decade respect to the preindustrial baseline. (2) A mean warming of 0.5 celcius for the 1960-2005 period respect to the preindustrial period. (3). For the 2006-2100 period under RCP4.5 scenario, was possible to identify a warming trend (0.028 degrees Cyear(-1)), which is above double the trend observed in the period 1960-2005 (0.012 degrees Cyear(-1)). 4) Largest trends over Iran occur for the 2006-2050 period (2.75 +/- 0.74 to 4.72 +/- 0.82 degrees C/century) respect to the 2006-2100 period (2.28 +/- 0.36 to 3.39 +/- 0.37 degrees C/century) with the most possible reason associated with the fact that under the RCP4.5 scenario, the emission rate increases toward 2040 and then stabilizes to the end of the century. All of these indicators evidence an intensification of the warming over the Iran region respect to the global trends. From the spatial analysis of surface air temperature trends over 5 regions of Iran for the 1850-2005, 1960-2005, 2006-2050 and 2006-2100 periods was possible to identify a significant increase in all the trends over Iran, but specially in the Southwestern of the country with a warming rate higher in warm regions than the cold climate regions.

An observational, descriptive and retrospective study was designed that systematized demographic information, clinical signs and the time elapsed between the beginning of these and the investigation, notification and confirmation of the cases. In total, 130 confirmed positive cases for Zika and 44 for dengue were recovered. The greatest number of cases were reported between epidemiological weeks 12 and 15 and in women (76.9% of Zika and 63.6% of dengue). The greatest number of Zika and dengue cases occurred in the age group of 20-29 years (30.0 and 27%, respectively). The most frequent clinical signs in both cases were exanthema, headache, myalgia, ocular/retrocular pain and arthralgia/polyarthralgia. The relationship between the temporal behaviour of the cases and the interventions carried out show that the nebulization application had a greater effect, reducing the number of confirmed cases after the application.

The built environment contributes around 40% of total global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; action is vital. Whilst building code standards have increased, rating tools and technology to reduce energy and water consumption are developed; environmental impact grows because of human behaviour. In the tertiary education sector, student accommodation constitutes a large part of the property portfolio, contributing significant amounts of GHG emissions and environmental impact. Property Managers can educate and install systems and technologies to improve behaviour if they understand it. Design/methodology/approach This exploratory study used a questionnaire survey to explore how student's worldviews vary and the possible limitations to behaviour in respect of climate change. In total, 71 responses from international university students living in residential accommodation on campuses in Stockholm were analysed. Findings The results show different perceptions about the environment and actions that are needed, and this leads to different behaviours. Limited knowledge and inability to relate environmental consequences to one's own actions, effective communication and risk averse behaviour, are critical in mitigating climate change. A deeper understanding of participants worldviews and the different resulting behaviours was achieved. Research limitations/implications This pilot study involved a small number of participants and future studies should expand participant numbers, including those with more varied backgrounds, education levels and age groups. Practical implications If property managers gain a deeper understanding the different behaviours of their residents, they can develop effective strategies to facilitate action that will lower the environment impact and GHG emissions of student accommodation. Originality/value The knowledge gained about environmental attitudes and human behaviour can help property and facility managers, policy makers and regulators to develop more effective strategies to deliver improved sustainability outcomes.","2021-04-28","2023-09-26 16:12:47","2023-09-26 16:12:47","","305-324","","3","39","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000619595800001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;88</p>","","","Climate change; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RISK; IMPACTS; EFFICIENCY; Environment; Sustainability; BARRIERS; PERCEPTIONS; INTERVENTIONS; SUSTAINABILITY; PSYCHOLOGY; Action; Behaviour; OPTIMISM","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While large federal reclamation projects once dominated western water management and provided ample water for large scale agricultural development as well as the urbanization of the West, water engineering alone is no longer sufficient or, in some cases, a politically acceptable policy option. As demand for water in the West increases with an ever-growing population, climate change is presenting a more challenging and potentially untenable, reality of even longer periods of drought and insufficient water quantity. The complexity of managing water resources under climate change conditions will require multifaceted and publicly acceptable strategies. This paper therefore examines water policy preferences of residents in four western states: Washington, Oregon, California, and Idaho. Using a public survey conducted in these states in 2019, we examine preferences pertaining to infrastructural, education, incentives and regulation specifically examining levels of support for varying policies based on climate change and environmental efficacy beliefs as well as geography, demographic variables, and political ideology. Results show support for all water policies surveyed, with the exception of charging higher rates for water during the hottest part of summer. The most preferred water policies pertained to tax incentives. Some variation of support exists based on gender, education, environmental values, efficacy, state residency and belief in anthropogenic climate change.","2021-07","2023-09-26 16:12:47","2023-09-26 16:12:47","","","","13","18","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000671955900001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;62</p>","","","climate change; ATTITUDES; BEHAVIOR; KNOWLEDGE; COLLECTIVE EFFICACY; VALUES; CONSERVATION; environmental efficacy; INTENTION; water policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The agriculture sector depends on the climate and may be susceptible to future climate changes, such as increasing temperature, heavy rainfall, droughts, and floods directly impacting cotton productivity. This study empirically investigates the relationship between climate change variables and non-climate change variables on cotton productivity in Pakistan. An econometric technique, the ""autoregressive distributed lag model"" (ARDL), was employed on time series data from 1970 to 2018 to explore the existence and nature of the relationship among variables. The findings indicated the presence of co-integration among variables which confirms the long-run relationship among the variables. At the same time, the empirical results revealed that increases in temperature and rainfall positively affected cotton productivity. However, CO2 harms cotton productivity. Moreover, infrastructural changes positively affect cotton productivity in both the long and short run, while labor is negatively related to productivity. The area, fertilizer, and seed consumption showed a significant positive effect on cotton productivity. We employed the dynamic ordinary least squares (OLS), co-integration regression estimation, and the series test to validate the robustness of the finding. The finding of this study urges policymakers to devise a comprehensive policy to mitigate the adverse effect of climate change and upsurge water conservation. Furthermore, it is imperative to adopt environmentally friendly production inputs and modern techniques, which helps to gain sustainable cotton productivity. To conclude, the cotton crop is significantly affected by climate change subject to the region. Although this study analyzed the Pakistan case, the model can be generalized to all the developing countries.","2021","2023-09-26 16:12:46","2023-09-26 16:12:46","","1455-1462","","5","58","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000760164100005","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;38</p>","","","Pakistan; Climate Change; Productivity; Cotton; ARDL","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to funding priorities, Arctic passerines have been studied less intensively than waterfowl and shorebirds. In our study, we aim to partly fill this gap and look at the change in passerine community species composition in the Chaun River Delta in Northeast Siberia (68.81 degrees N, 170.62 degrees E) between 1970-1980 and 2002-2019. We restricted our comparison to 16 tundra-dwelling species associated with grass and shrub tundra habitats. During the first period, 12 passerine species were reported and by the end of the last period, 14 species. Our observations show that four species of shrub-dwelling passerines, the Dusky Warbler (Phylloscopus fuscatus), two species of Turdus thrushes, and the Siberian Rubythroat (Calliope calliope), have joined the local community. Additionally, one Turdus thrush species increased in numbers. The only passerine species that used to be common in the 70's and rare in the 2000s is the Lapland Bunting (Calcarius lapponicus). Yellow-breasted Bunting (Emberiza aureola, vagrant in 70's) and Siberian Chiffchaff (Phylloscopus tristis, rare breeder in 70's) have not been recorded during the most recent period. At the same time, there was no observed change in abundance for eight species of songbirds. The results of supervised satellite image classification did not detect any local-scale increase of shrub cover in our study site. However, a broad-scale assessment of vegetation change using NDVI suggests substantial greening or 'shrubification' across the region. We speculate that it promotes region-wide increases and range expansion of some shrub-dwelling species, recorded in our study.","2021-09","2023-09-26 16:12:46","2023-09-26 16:12:46","","1847-1857","","9","44","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000683708300001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;45</p>","","","Climate change; CLIMATE-CHANGE; HABITAT; EXPANSION; Community dynamic; Shrubification; Tundra; TUNDRA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is in part due to the important role of public perception of expert consensus, which has downstream impacts on public opinion and support for mitigation policies. Numerous studies, using diverse methodologies and measures of climate expertise, have quantified the scientific consensus, finding between 90% and 100% agreement on human-caused global warming with multiple studies converging on 97% agreement. This study revisits the consensus among geoscientists ten years after an initial survey of experts, while exploring different ways to define expertise and the level of agreement among these groups. We sent 10 929 invitations to participate in our survey to a verified email list of geosciences faculty at reporting academic and research institutions and received 2780 responses. In addition to analyzing the raw survey results, we independently quantify how many publications self-identified climate experts published in the field of climate change research and compare that to their survey response on questions about climate change. As well as a binary approach classifying someone as 'expert' or 'non-expert', we also look at expertise as a scale. We find that agreement on anthropogenic global warming is high (91% to 100%) and generally increases with expertise. Out of a group of 153 independently confirmed climate experts, 98.7% of those scientists indicated that the Earth is getting warmer mostly because of human activity such as burning fossil fuels. Among those with the highest level of expertise (independently confirmed climate experts who each published 20+ peer reviewed papers on climate change between 2015 and 2019) there was 100% agreement that the Earth is warming mostly because of human activity.","2021-10","2023-09-26 16:12:46","2023-09-26 16:12:46","","","","10","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000709096900001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;8<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;8<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;19</p>","","","climate change; anthropogenic global warming; consensus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In its formal definition, three flow characteristics need to be minimally maintained: quantity, timing and quality. This overview paper highlights the challenges of some of the current methods used for eflow determination in the context of an evolving climate. As hydrological methods remain popular, they are first analyzed by describing some of the potential caveats associated with their usage when flow time series are non-stationarity. The timing of low-flow events will likely change within a season but will also likely shift in seasonality in some regions. Flow quality is a multi-faceted concept. It is proposed that a first simple step to partly incorporate flow quality in future analyses is to include the water temperature as a covariate. Finally, holistic approaches are also critically revisited, and simple modifications to the Ecological Limits of Flow Alteration (ELOHA) framework are proposed.","2021-05","2023-09-26 16:12:46","2023-09-26 16:12:46","","","","9","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000650873200001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;50</p>","","","climate change; TRENDS; FRAMEWORK; REGIMES; CHANGE IMPACT; QUALITY; environmental flows; river ecosystems; THERMAL SENSITIVITY; WATER TEMPERATURE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, spatiotemporal characteristics and variability of the impact of ENSO and MJO on drought were analyzed from the perspectives of meteorological drought and agricultural drought through temporal and spatial correlation analyses of China's 48 eco-geographical regions. The results show a strong correlation between drought and ENSO and MJO in general. The spatial correlation coefficients are different, and the response of extreme events varies in different regions. The influence of ENSO and MJO on agricultural drought is higher than that on meteorological drought. ENSO and MJO have a considerable influence on agricultural drought in regions such as the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and Xinjiang, with the highest correlation coefficient of 0.72. A significant influence of ENSO and MJO on meteorological drought was found in the Jiangnan region with the highest correlation coefficient of 0.40. In addition, agricultural drought shows a significant time lag in response to ENSO events. When the lag time is six months, the time series presents the highest correlation coefficient with the mean value of the correlation coefficient reaching 0.38 and the maximum value reaching 0.75. This research is of great significance for understanding the spatiotemporal correlation between climate patterns and drought on a large regional scale and it provides further insights into the teleconnection mechanisms of drought.","2021-03","2023-09-26 16:12:46","2023-09-26 16:12:46","","","","5","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000628511000001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;8<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;8<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;68</p>","","","RAINFALL; TEMPERATURE; VARIABILITY; PRECIPITATION; VEGETATION; global climate change; IMPACTS; INDEX; EVENTS; ENSO; SOUTHERN-OSCILLATION; MJO; correction; MODIS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective of this study was to use the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) dataset along with rain gauges to characterize aspects of rainfall spatial variability and discuss the possible impacts from recent trends in the Brazilian savannah biome (Cerrado). Gauge stations were used to assess TRMM bias error and calibrate data for further analyses. Rainfall rates and their spatial variability showed a strong relationship to the transition zones between different biomes. Rainfall showed a decreasing trend for the eastern region of the Cerrado biome, a region characterized by a recent and significant expansion of crop areas. These trends agree with results from different studies which highlight the current drawdown of groundwater levels and reduced discharge, and possible lengthening of the dry season in the long run. As many conflicts have already been documented for this region, these decreasing trends are alarming for urgent and consistent hydroclimatic monitoring, and improved water resources planning and management. Positive trends for rainfall in the central Cerrado are likely a momentary recovery of recent-period drought.","2021-11","2023-09-26 16:12:46","2023-09-26 16:12:46","","","","","111","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000700592100002","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;48</p>","","","DROUGHT; Climate change; PRECIPITATION; MODELS; TIME-SERIES; STATE; SYSTEMS; IRRIGATION; SATELLITE; Cerrado; Satellite meteorology; TRMM","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we focus on rice harvests across Asia and estimate the future impact on labour productivity by considering changes in climate at the time of the annual harvest. During these specific times of the year, heat stress is often high compared to the rest of the year. Examining climate simulations of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6), we identified that labour productivity metrics for the rice harvest, based on local wet-bulb globe temperature, are strongly correlated with global mean near-surface air temperature in the long term (p MUCH LESS-THAN 0.01, R (2) > 0.98 in all models). Limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees C rather than 2.0 degrees C prevents a clear reduction in labour capacity of 1% across all Asia and 2% across Southeast Asia, affecting the livelihoods of around 100 million people. Due to differences in mechanization between and within countries, we find that rice labour is especially vulnerable in Indonesia, the Philippines, Bangladesh, and the Indian states of West Bengal and Kerala.

The ""climate-augmented"" monetary policy is pioneeringly proposed and studied. We build an extended Environmental Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (E-DSGE) model as the method. By this model, we find the following results. First, the making process of monetary policy should consider the existing climate policy since it is a factor that can influence price level and inflation. Second, the reaction coefficients in traditional monetary policy rule can be better set to enhance welfare when climate policy is given. This provides a way to optimise the policy mix. Third, if a typical-form climate target is augmented into the monetary policy rule, a dilemma could be created.

This practice, consisting in the strategic supplementation of calves during lactation, has greater impact in marginal environments with frequent droughts. This paper evaluates economically the marginal results of the adoption of creepfeeding combined with early weaning as an alternative option to traditional weaning in cattle raising in the semiarid southwest of the Province of Buenos Aires (SOB) in Argentina.

Successful attempts at biodiversity conservation requires an understanding of biodiversity patterns as well as the drivers and processes that determine those patterns. To deepen this knowledge, neoecologists have focused on studying present-day or recent historical data, while paleoecologists usually study long-term data through the composition of various biological proxies and environmental indicators. By establishing standard protocols or gathering databases, research infrastructures (RIs) have been instrumental to foster exchange and collaboration among scientists within neoecology (e.g. Global Information Biodiversity Facility or National Ecological Observatory Network) and paleoecology (e.g. Paleobiology Database, Neotoma Paleoecology Database or European Pollen Database). However, these two subdisciplines (and their RIs) have traditionally remained segregated although both provide valuable information that combined can improve our understanding of biodiversity drivers and underlying processes, as well as our predictions of biodiversity responses in the future. For instance, integrative studies between paleo- and neoecology have addressed the global challenge of biodiversity loss by validating climate and ecological models, estimating species fundamental niches, understanding ecological changes and trajectories, or establishing baseline conditions for restoration. Supporting and contributing to research infrastructures from both paleo- and neoecology, as well as their further integration, could boost the amount and improve the quality of such integrative studies. We argue this will enable improved capabilities to anticipate the impacts of global change and biodiversity losses. To boost such integration and illustrate our arguments, we (1) review studies integrating paleo- and neoecology to advance in the light of global changes challenge, (2) describe RIs developed in paleoecology, and (3) discuss opportunities for further integration of RIs from both disciplines (i.e. paleo- and neoecology).","2021-09","2023-09-26 16:12:45","2023-09-26 16:12:45","","","","9","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000687839500001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;7<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;7<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;140</p>","","","climate change; VEGETATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; environmental change; HIGH-RESOLUTION; RECORD; LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM; ECOLOGY; biodiversity loss; FOSSIL POLLEN; global changes; MIDDLE PLEISTOCENE; neoecology; paleoecology; QUANTITATIVE RECONSTRUCTION; research infrastructures; SOURCE AREA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To account for selection bias due to both observable and unobservable factors where more than two options arise, the multinomial endogenous switching regression model was used to analyze the collected data. The empirical findings revealed that level of education brought about increase in the probability of adopting bore-hole construction, stocking time adjustment and embankment creation as adaptation strategies to climate change. Also, adoption of stocking time adjustment and embankment creation by the adopters increased food security index by 106.1 and 16.9%, respectively. Furthermore, adoption of stocking time adjustment in the adopters' category reduced the poverty gap by 87.2%. It is, therefore, recommended that policies which promote adoption of climate change adaptation strategies (especially stocking time adjustment and bore-hole construction being the strategies with the highest impact) should be formulated since they are capable of increasing welfare of aquaculture fish farmers.","2021-10-02","2023-09-26 16:12:45","2023-09-26 16:12:45","","450-471","","4","25","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000627265300001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;48</p>","","","climate change; IMPACT; Adaptation; fish; MESR; welfare","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we analyse precipitation extremes in high-resolution simulations that are run without a convective parameterization on a quasi-global aquaplanet. The frequency distributions of precipitation rates and precipitation cluster sizes in the tropics of a control simulation are similar to the observed distributions. In response to climate warming, 3 h precipitation extremes increase at rates of up to 9% K-1 in the tropics because of a combination of positive thermodynamic and dynamic contributions. The dynamic contribution at different latitudes is connected to the vertical structure of warming using a moist static stability. When the precipitation rates are first averaged to a daily timescale and coarse-grained to a typical global climate-model resolution prior to calculating the precipitation extremes, the response of the precipitation extremes to warming becomes more similar to what was found previously in coarse-resolution aquaplanet studies. However, the simulations studied here do not exhibit the high rates of increase of tropical precipitation extremes found in projections with some global climate models.

The UK National Health Service is committed to being a net zero emitter by 2040, and a potential contribution to this target could come from reductions in patient travel. Achieving this will require actions at many levels. We sought to determine potential savings and risks over the short term from telemedicine through virtual clinics. Methods: During the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-2-CoV) pandemic, scheduled face-to-face epilepsy clinics at a specialist site were replaced by remote teleclinics. We used a standard methodology applying conversion factors to calculate emissions based on the total saved travel distance. A further conversion factor was used to derive emissions associated with electricity consumption to deliver remote clinics from which net savings could be calculated. Patients' records and clinicians were interrogated to identify any adverse clinical outcomes. Results: We found that enforced telemedicine delivery for over 1200 patients resulted in the saving of similar to 224 000 km of travel with likely avoided emissions in the range of 35 000-40 000 kg carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) over a six and half month period. Emissions arising directly from remote delivery were calculated to be <200 kg CO(2)e (similar to 0.5% of those for travel), representing a significant net reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Only one direct adverse outcome was identified, with some additional benefits identified anecdotally. Significance: The use of telemedicine can make a contribution toward reduced emissions in the health care sector and, in the delivery of specialized epilepsy services, had minimal adverse clinical outcomes over the short term. However, these outcomes will likely vary with clinic locations, medical specialties and conditions.","2021-11","2023-09-26 16:12:45","2023-09-26 16:12:45","","2732-2740","","11","62","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000691254800001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;19<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;19<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;37</p>","","","climate change; ENERGY; pandemic; global heating; neurology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many seeding programs in this region target cold-season orographic clouds with ground-based silver iodide generators. Here, the ""seedability'' (defined as the fraction of time that conditions are suitable for ground-based seeding) is evaluated in this region from 10 years of hourly output from a regional climate model with a horizontal resolution of 4 km. Seedability criteria are based on temperature, presence of supercooled liquid water, and Froude number, which is computed here as a continuous field relative to the local terrain. The model's supercooled liquid water compares reasonably well to microwave radiometer observations. Seedability peaks at 20%-30% for many mountain ranges in the cold season, with the best locations just upwind of crests, over the highest terrain in Colorado and Wyoming, as well as over ranges in the northwest interior. Mountains farther south are less frequently seedable, because of warmer conditions, but when they are, cloud supercooled liquid water content tends to be relatively high. This analysis is extended into a future climate, anticipated for later this century, with a mean temperature 2.0K warmer than the historical climate. Seedability generally will be lower in this future warmer climate, especially in the most seedable areas, but, when seedable, clouds tend to contain slightly more supercooled liquid water.","2021-09","2023-09-26 16:12:45","2023-09-26 16:12:45","","1245-1263","","9","60","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000754475800005","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;59</p>","","","Climate change; PRECIPITATION; SIMULATIONS; IMPACT; SENSITIVITY; IMPLEMENTATION; AEROSOL; MULTISENSOR; OROGRAPHIC CLOUD; Orographic effects; PARAMETERIZATION; SNOWFALL; Weather modification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Serengeti National Park (SNP) is a critical East African protected area, where seasonal vegetation cycles support vast populations of grazing herbivores and a host of ecosystem dynamics. Previous work has shown how non-climate drivers (e.g. land use) shape the SNP ecosystem, but it is still unclear to what extent changing climate conditions influence SNP vegetation, particularly at finer spatial and temporal scales. We fill this research gap by evaluating long-term (1982-2016) changes in SNP leaf area index (LAI) in relation to both temperature and moisture availability using Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition and Principal Component Analysis with regression techniques. We find that SNP LAI trends are nonlinear, display high sub-seasonal variation, and are influenced by lagged changes in both moisture and temperature variables and their interactions. LAI during the long rains (e.g. March) exhibits a greening-to-browning trend reversal starting in the early 2000s, partly due to antecedent precipitation declines. In contrast, LAI during the short rains (e.g. November, December) displays browning-to-greening alongside increasing moisture availability. Rising temperature trends also have important, secondary interactions with moisture variables to shape these SNP vegetation trends. Our findings show complex vegetation-climate interactions occurring at important temporal and spatial scales of the SNP, and our rigorous statistical approaches detect these complex climate-vegetation trends and interactions, while guarding against spurious vegetation signals.","2021-09","2023-09-26 16:12:45","2023-09-26 16:12:45","","","","9","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000693405100001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;78</p>","","","climate change; RAINFALL; LAND-USE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PROTECTED AREAS; PRODUCTIVITY; PREDICTABILITY; TIME-SERIES; protected areas; RESOLUTION; EASTERN AFRICA; EEMD; EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; vegetation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The results highlight a widespread perception of climate change as a general threat for the environment, but not directly transposed to the frequency and intensity of future geohazards. Certainly, changes in temperatures and rainfall are widely expected and acknowledged, yet the comprehension related to the hydrogeological effects seems to vary proportionally to the physical proximity to these hazards. Such outcomes underline that there is still a common lack of understanding of the eventual local impact of the climate crisis.

In this study, snow thickness and areal distribution were monitored using a time lapse camera over a grid of 15 x 20 m between 2009 and 2017 at Signy Island (60 degrees S, South Orkney Islands, maritime Antarctica). The data obtained confirmed high spatial and temporal variability in snow cover. Over the study period, the mean annual snow depth ranged between 5.6 cm (2017) and 11.1 cm (2012) while the maximum of the mean daily snow depth across the entire grid ranged between 17.1 cm (2017) and 50.1 cm (2015). No temporal trend was apparent but there was a strong correlation with mean annual air temperature, suggesting that possible future warming could decrease snow depth in the area. A negative correlation was identified between the winter Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and mean annual snow depth, indicating an influence of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on snow cover in this part of Antarctica. There was considerable small-scale spatial variability in snow depth at each individual stake, with mean values between 3.9 and 25.3 cm and maximum values between 27 and 85 cm. Snow depth variability was influenced primarily by microtopography and wind direction, but also by the land cover type (vegetation).

In particular, the study estimates the impacts by separating them into the residential, commercial, industrial, and agricultural sectors. The study found that temperature changes affect the electricity consumption of all four sectors. However, the size and shape of impacts vary depending on the sector. While the commercial and industrial electricity consumption increase both in hot and cold temperatures, residential consumption increases only in hot temperatures. The agricultural sector shows that its consumption responds to cold temperatures more significantly than hot temperatures. These results suggest that the sectoral variations should be considered when predicting future electricity consumption. With an assumption of 2 degrees C average temperature increases, the electricity consumption of residential, commercial, industrial, and agricultural sectors is projected to increase by 6%, 8%, 1%, and 4% in the summer season (July to September), respectively. In the spatial analysis, the annual consumption of residential and commercial sectors is projected to increase in most counties while the agricultural sector shows the opposite result. With 2 degrees C and 5 degrees C average temperature increases, the study found that total electricity consumption in August would increase by 4.1% (1.5TWh) and 11.3% (4.1TWh). This would create additional costs of $0.17 billion and $0.45 billion with an assumption that the average marginal cost of electricity in South Korea was 11 cents per kWh.","2021-11","2023-09-26 16:12:45","2023-09-26 16:12:45","","","","04","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000757324300001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;23</p>","","","ADAPTATION; Climate change; DEMAND; IMPACTS; MORTALITY; WEATHER; electricity consumption; impacts estimation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We use a world economy model that covers almost all the countries around the world, and distinguishes between rural and urban regions as well as between flooded and unflooded areas. The model is calibrated to match international and internal mobility data by education level for the last 30 years, and is then simulated under climate change variants. We endogenize the size, dyadic, and skill structure of climate migration. When considering moderate climate scenarios, we predict mobility responses in the range of 70-108 million workers over the course of the twenty-first century. Most of these movements are local or inter-regional. South-South international migration responses are smaller, while the South-North migration response is of the ""brain drain"" type and induces a permanent increase in the number of foreigners in OECD countries in the range of 6-9% only. Changes in the sea level mainly translate into forced local movements. By contrast, inter-regional and international movements are sensitive to temperature-related changes in productivity. Lastly, we show that relaxing international migration restrictions may exacerbate the poverty effect of climate change at origin if policymakers are unable to select/screen individuals in extreme poverty.","2021-09","2023-09-26 16:12:58","2023-09-26 16:12:58","","345-381","","3","87","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000684262200005","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;53</p>","","","climate change; VARIABILITY; MODEL; urbanization; WEATHER; LABOR; migration; INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION; ECONOMY; INEQUALITY; SHOCKS; Brain drain","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Objectives The objective of this study was to survey the opinions of equine veterinary teams in the UK regarding the importance of sustainability issues, and current practices employed to promote sustainability. Study design Online survey. Methods The survey was distributed through various email veterinary listservs and social media sites, and was open to equine veterinary surgeons, veterinary nurses, veterinary students and practice administrators/managers. Results A total of 374 responses were received. Seventy-seven per cent of respondents considered sustainability issues to be extremely important or very important, but only 13% felt knowledgeable/well-informed about practical ways of promoting sustainability in equine veterinary practice. Fifty-six per cent of respondents stated that their organisations/practices had not introduced sustainability protocols. Over 50% of respondents considered that their organisations were dealing well with the issues of antimicrobial stewardship, anthelmintic stewardship and drug disposal, but less than 25% considered that their organisations were dealing well with fossil fuels, travel, disposable materials, responsible paper sourcing, water saving and communicating sustainability issues.

This study investigated the separate effect of each of these factors for runoff from the important Tunisian Merguellil catchment. For this purpose, more than forty years of hydrological data were used. The methodology was based on hydrological characterization, NDVI index to monitor land use dynamics, and the Budyko approach to specify origin of change. The results show that hydrological change is much more important upstream than downstream. The last three decades display a 40% reduction in runoff. This is associated with the direct influence of humans, who are responsible for about 78% of the variation in flow. It appears that climate change contributes to less than about 22%. The combination of increased cultivated land and decreased annual rainfall is the main reason for reduced catchment runoff. Consequently, these effects threaten the sustainable runoff, water in reservoirs, and future water supply in general. Ultimately, the available runoff remains an important parameter and a key indicator to guide the choices of decision-makers and practitioners in current and future climatic conditions. This contributes to supporting sustainable management of remaining water resources.","2021-10","2023-09-26 16:12:58","2023-09-26 16:12:58","","","","19","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000708060400001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;83</p>","","","climate change; RAINFALL; VARIABILITY; EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; RUNOFF; STREAMFLOW; CATCHMENT; MODELS; anthropogenic impact; ELASTICITY; INNOVATIVE TREND ANALYSIS; LAND-USE CHANGES; runoff trend","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to understand the effects of elevated temperature on African reptile physiology and health, additional research is required. We studied the physiological stress response of sungazer lizards (Smaug giganteus) facing elevated temperatures within captivity. Control animals (1M, 2F) were kept at 30 degrees C throughout the 13-week study period. Test animals (1M, 2F) were exposed to 30 degrees C for four weeks (stage 1), 39 degrees C for six weeks (stage 2) and 30 degrees C for three weeks (stage 3). Faecal samples were collected from both control and test animals to monitor faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (fGCM) concentrations as a proxy of physiological stress. Although the fGCM levels of control females remained constant, test females showed an acute fGCM increase following the increase and subsequent decrease of temperatures. The test male had significantly higher fGCM levels during stage 3, compared with stage 1 and 2. The control male, although displaying constant fGCM levels throughout the study, had higher fGCM levels than the test male. The results indicate that a considerable temporal increase in environmental temperature did not lead to chronically elevated adrenocortical activity in sungazer lizards. It is likely that inherent traits within the species allow the species to adapt to such changes. Furthermore, the endangered status of the species and limited availability of study animals restricted the sample size in this study to a few, captive-based lizards. Therefore, although our results are an important addition to reptile conservation, they should be extrapolated to free-ranging populations with caution. Future research should consider the effects of chronically elevated temperature in relation to water and food shortages, as well as interindividual variation in physiological responses.","2021-07-03","2023-09-26 16:12:58","2023-09-26 16:12:58","","222-230","","3","56","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000703835900001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;81</p>","","","climate change; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BEHAVIOR; adrenocortical; CORTICOSTERONE; glucocorticoids; IMMUNE FUNCTION; INDIVIDUAL VARIATION; PLASTICITY; reptile physiology; REPTILES; STRESS RESPONSES; THERMAL TOLERANCE; THERMOREGULATION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this paper is to explore the determinants of consumers' willingness to fight climate change and the probability of their purchase of an electric car, as an action that potentially helps mitigate climate change. Design/Methodology/Approach - The analysis relies on Eurobarometer survey responses of 25,009 individuals from 28 European countries. The determinants of probability of taking action to fight climate change and the determinants of probability of buying an electric car are identified using the Heckman selection model. Findings and implications - The results show that people who are aware of the gravity of climate change and believe that it requires action at all levels of government, business sectors and citizens are more likely to engage in pro-environmental actions. As for electric car purchase, consumers belonging to the middle class and higher classes as well as consumers satisfied with their lives are more likely to buy electric cars than others. However, their attitudes to climate change and actors responsible for it have no impact on their actual purchase. Limitations - The main limitation of this research study is associated with the choice of variables, which was limited to those available in the Eurobarometer survey. Originality - This paper contributes to a better understanding of factors behind environmentally friendly behavior and purchase of electric cars on a large sample of European consumers. Unlike most of the research in this field, the analysis is based on actual purchase data instead of purchase intention.","2021-12","2023-09-26 16:12:58","2023-09-26 16:12:58","","81-94","","","33","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000744194400006","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;41</p>","","","climate change; CONSUMPTION; PRO-ENVIRONMENTAL BEHAVIOR; PRODUCTS; electric cars; green consumers; GREEN PURCHASE; VEHICLES","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Considering the growing levels of climate change awareness across the world, negative emotions like anxiety and worry about climate-related risks are a potentially pervasive conduit for the adverse impacts of climate change on mental health. In this study, we examined how negative climate-related emotions relate to sleep and mental health among a diverse non-representative sample of individuals recruited from 25 countries, as well as a Norwegian nationally-representative sample. Overall, we found that negative climate-related emotions are positively associated with insomnia symptoms and negatively related to self-rated mental health in most countries.

These practices directly interfere on the carbon dynamics between the land and atmosphere. In this study, we investigated the temporal variability of the column-averaged dry-air mole fraction of atmospheric CO2 (xCO2), solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in areas with the main agroecosystems in southern-central Brazil as a way to understand if and how crops cycle and agricultural management could be associated with the temporal variability of NDVI, SIF and xCO2. The study was carried out in areas corresponding to the three agroecosystems?: sugarcane (Prad?opolis, State of Sa?o Paulo, Brazil), cropland with soybean-corn succession (Santo Anto?nio do Para?so, State of Paran?a, Brazil), and grassland (?Aguas Claras, State of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil). Air temperature, precipitation, NDVI, and SIF and xCO2 were retrieved from NASA-POWER, NASA-GIOVANNI, SATVeg-EMBRAPA, and OCO-2, respectively, during a two-year study. Trends were removed from the NDVI, SIF, and xCO2 time series applying the regression method. A negative correlation between SIF and xCO2 was found in sugarcane and cropland areas, but in grasslands, no correlation showed up. Higher SIF values were observed in grassland (2.24 W m-2 sr-1 ?m-1), and lower xCO2 values were observed above grains, which varied from 396.8 to 404.2 ppm. Both xCO2 and SIF followed more a seasonal pattern in sugarcane and annual crops, but over pasture this presented an unusual pattern related to higher precipitation events. Our results indicate a potential use of SIF and xCO2 which could help identifying potential sources and sinks of the main additional greenhouse gas over agricultural areas.","2021-06-15","2023-09-26 16:12:57","2023-09-26 16:12:57","","","","","288","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000643640500001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;7<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;7<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;65</p>","","","DYNAMICS; Climate-smart agriculture; Remote sensing; CARBON; GROSS PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY; AREA; Climate changes; CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE; COEFFICIENT; DIFFERENCE VEGETATION INDEX; OCO-2; SIF; SOIL CO2 EMISSION; SUN-INDUCED FLUORESCENCE; WATER AVAILABILITY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Also, almost all the respondents noted that climate change and lagoon pollution impact negatively on the lagoon which subsequently affect their fishing activities. The fishermen reported difficulty in meeting basic livelihood essentials including feeding their family, paying of their children school expenses, paying of hospital and utility bills.

We review the growing literature on carbon pricing shortfalls, and suggest a conceptual framework to differentiate three dimensions of failure, based on different manifestations of human behaviour: Homo Economicus, Homo Irrationalis, and Homo Politicus.

The study was based on geomorphic research, sampling and dating fluvial sediments by optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and anthropogenic contamination by Sn since 16th century. During the LGM and the Pleistocene/Holocene transition (P/H), the river valley was shaped by large, incising meanders creating the entire valley floor. The Holocene river, due to decreased channel forming discharges, only slowly continued the LGM and P/H trajectory by cut-offs of the large palaeomeander necks and channel belt narrowing and incision. The last Holocene incision step was likely triggered by hydrological extremes of the Little Ice Age. The LGM and P/H Ohre River consequently changed from meandering to low sinuous, incised in the valley floor; this incision was completed by river engineering in the 20th century. The Ohre River development can thus be rationalised neither by traditional terrace-step formation model nor by model of the Anthropogenic aggradation.","2021-05","2023-09-26 16:12:57","2023-09-26 16:12:57","","","","5","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000653930900001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;70</p>","","","CLIMATE-CHANGE; DYNAMICS; BASIN; CATCHMENT; EVOLUTION; climate extremes; climate changes; POLLUTION; HISTORY; anthropogenic impact; FLOODPLAIN; fluvial response; LATE PLEISTOCENE; river systems; SINGLE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For example, April 1 snow water equivalent (SWE) has been an effective index for streamflow forecasting, but it cannot express the effects of midwinter melt events, now expected in warming snow climates, nor can we assume that station-based measurements will be representative of snow conditions in future decades. Remote sensing and climate model data provide capacity for a suite of multi-use snow metrics from local to global scales. Such indicators need to be simple enough to ""tell the story"" of snowpack changes over space and time, but not overly simplistic or overly complicated in their interpretation. We describe a suite of spatially explicit, multi-temporal snow metrics based on global satellite data from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and downscaled climate model output for the U.S. We describe and provide examples for Snow Cover Frequency (SCF), Snow Disappearance Date (SDD), At-Risk Snow (ARS), and Frequency of a Warm Winter (FWW). Using these retrospective and prospective snow metrics, we assess the current and future snow-related conditions in three hydroclimatically different U.S. watersheds: the Truckee, Colorado Headwaters, and Upper Connecticut. In the two western U.S. watersheds, SCF and SDD show greater sensitivity to annual differences in snow cover compared with data from the ground-based Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) network. The eastern U.S. watershed does not have a ground-based network of data, so these MODIS-derived metrics provide uniquely valuable snow information. The ARS and FWW metrics show that the Truckee Watershed is highly vulnerable to conversion from snowfall to rainfall (ARS) and midwinter melt events (FWW) throughout the seasonal snow zone. In comparison, the Colorado Headwaters and Upper Connecticut Watersheds are colder and much less vulnerable through mid- and late-century.","2021-06","2023-09-26 16:12:57","2023-09-26 16:12:57","","","","6","35","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000667549500032","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;9<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;9<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;60</p>","","","climate change; VARIABILITY; FRAMEWORK; STREAMFLOW; CLIMATE-CHANGE; COVER; climate model; PERSPECTIVES; SATELLITE; ARCTIC TUNDRA; DISAPPEARANCE; remote sensing; SNOTEL; snow cover; SnowCloudMetrics; WESTERN US","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We find that environmental shareholder activism increases the voluntary disclosure of climate change risks, especially if initiated by institutional investors, and even more so if initiated by long-term institutional investors. We also find that companies that voluntarily disclose climate change risks following environmental shareholder activism achieve a higher valuation postdisclosure, suggesting that investors value transparency with respect to firms' exposure to climate change risks. Managerial Summary Climate change poses increasing risks to companies. Yet, despite the growing importance of climate change risks, little is known about companies' exposure to climate change risks, their disclosure of these risks, and what strategic actions they take to manage and mitigate these risks. In this study, we examine whether-in the absence of mandatory disclosure-shareholders can elicit greater corporate transparency with respect to climate change risks. We find that shareholder activism is effective, especially if initiated by long-term institutional investors. We also find that the stock market reacts positively to companies' climate risk disclosure following environmental shareholder activism, suggesting that investors value transparency with respect to firms' exposure to climate change risks.","2021-10","2023-09-26 16:12:57","2023-09-26 16:12:57","","1850-1879","","10","42","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000658041400001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;66<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;66<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;86</p>","","","climate change; MODEL; climate risk; REGRESSION; CAPITAL-MARKETS; corporate disclosure; corporate governance; CORPORATE GOVERNANCE; EARNINGS; FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE; INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS; OWNERSHIP; shareholder activism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DS are defined as consecutive sequences of days with daily precipitation less than 5 mm of the precipitation-per-day threshold (DS5). Daily precipitation data come from a dense national rain gauge network (covering seven regions) and span the period 1961-2015. The spatial and temporal changes of the observed mean (MDS5) and maximum (MxDS5) seasonal and annual dry spells were analysed by means of the Kendall tau method and the partial trend method. Future changes of DS5 were assessed by employing the three regional climate models (RegCM4, CCLM4 and RCA4) covering the EURO-CORDEX domain with a 12.5-km horizontal resolution, resulting in a realistic orography and land-sea border over Croatia. The models were forced at their boundaries by the four CMIP5 global climate models. For the reference period 1971-2000, the observed, as well as modelled, DS5 were analysed, and the systematic model errors were assessed. Finally, the projections and future changes of the DS5 statistics based on simulations under the high and medium greenhouse gases concentration scenarios (i.e., RCP8.5 and RCP4.5) with a focus on the climate change signal between 1971-2000 and two future periods, 2011-2040 and 2041-2070, were examined. A prevailing increasing trend of MDS5 was found in the warm part of the year, being significant in the mountainous littoral and North Adriatic coastal region. An increasing trend of MxDS5 was also found in the warm part of the year (both the spring and summer), and it was particularly pronounced along the Adriatic coast, while a coherent negative trend pattern was found in the autumn. By applying the partial trend methodology, an increase was found in the very long DS5 (above the 90th percentile) in the recent half of the analysed 55-year period in all seasons, except in the autumn when shortening in the DS5 was detected. The climate change signal during the two analysed future periods was positive for the summer in all regions, weakly negative for the winter and not conclusive for the spring, autumn and year. It was found that no RCM-GCM combination is the best in all cases, since the most successful model combinations depend on the season and location.","2021-05","2023-09-26 16:12:57","2023-09-26 16:12:57","","","","5","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000653469100001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;13<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;13<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;44</p>","","","climate change; TRENDS; DROUGHT; trends; REGION; climate models; EURO-CORDEX; CORDEX; PRECIPITATION EXTREMES; DISTRIBUTIONS; 2ND-HALF; BIASES; Croatia; dry spells; MODEL DESCRIPTION; PARTIAL DURATION SERIES","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Understanding the underlying aspects of climate change that influence ecosystems is crucial to devise adaptation strategies and conservation efforts. To this end, climate classification schemes can be employed as an effective means for both validation of climate models and identify areas that may experience a pronounced shift in climate in the future. In this context, the current study focuses on the impact of climate change on shift in climatic regimes over the Indian sub-continent for the mid and late 21st century with respect to the reference period (1975-2005). Koppen-Trewartha climate (KTC) classification was applied to climate projections resulting from four downscaled General Circulation Models from the NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Climate Projections, under two RCPs (4.5 and 8.5) along with global Climate Research Unit TS-3.23 dataset which is treated as observed. Analysis of the future 21st century climate projections revealed noticeable shifts in climate types, of which expansion of arid and savannah class is the most prominent. Results indicate that the sub-continental scale analysis done at a grid cell-by-grid cell basis was able to locate potentially static and dynamic climate regions across the country with projected shifts from warmer/wetter to drier climate regime. This in turn is expected to pose serious threat to various sectors, especially agriculture, owing to its heavy dependence on water resources. The observations from the study provide information on the magnitude and pattern of change in climate types across the country and thus can serve as prospective reference to develop adequate and effective climate adaptation strategies.","2021-12","2023-09-26 16:12:57","2023-09-26 16:12:57","","6616-6639","","15","41","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000661626200001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;42</p>","","","climate change; TEMPERATURE; EUROPE; GCM; SUMMER MONSOON; ENSEMBLE; climate classification; SHIFTS; HEAT WAVES; DATASET; CRU; FUTURE PROJECTIONS; Koppen-Trewartha; MULTIMODEL; NEX-GDDP; SOUTH","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We provide an overview of common methodological approaches and present evidence on their potential implications for the estimation of climatic impacts. We identify five key challenges, which relate to the i) measurement of migration and ii) climatic events, iii) the integration and aggregation of data, iv) the identification of causal relationships, and v) the exploration of contextual influences and mechanisms. Advances in research and modelling are discussed together with best practice cases to provide guidance to researchers studying the climate-migration nexus.

Considerable literature highlights that local knowledge can play an important role in climate change adaptation, particularly in small island countries. However, there is less understanding on how to practically integrate and apply local knowledge in climate change adaptation, particularly in the Cook Islands. This research investigated the role of local knowledge in climate change adaptation in the Cook Islands, aiming to understand the role of local knowledge in adaptation policies and the challenges of incorporating local knowledge into climate change adaptation policy through semistructured interviews with key informants and local participants. Key informants often recognized the important role of local knowledge in climate change adaptation while local knowledge was less recognized by local participants. Concerns over both the usefulness of the knowledge today and the loss of this knowledge were expressed. Additionally, challenges to integrating local knowledge into climate change policy were identified, including development pressure, out-migration, and a lack of understanding of local knowledge.

A hydrodynamic model was calibrated for a baseline scenario and three representative scenarios of climate change adopted by the Inter-Governmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) were analyzed for year 2050. The Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) was applied to evaluate wind speed and direction, and precipitation for the IPCC scenarios. Comparing the different scenarios, results showed that the changes in water level are relatively small. A harmonic analysis of the main components (M2, S2, O1 and K1) showed that the diurnal harmonics are amplified for 2050 scenarios. The semidiurnal constituents were amplified or damped, depending on the station analyzed. The form number showed that for the Laranjeiras bay, there was a change from semidiurnal tide in the baseline scenario to mixed tide for the 2050 scenarios. It was also analyzed the amplification factor, defined as the relation between the amplitude of the simulated harmonic constant and the amplitude of the harmonic constant in the open boundary condition. Also, the results show a dominance of the principal lunar semidiurnal constituent (M2), principal solar semidiurnal constituent (S2) and the lunar terdiurnal (M3), that together are responsible for approximately 50% of the tidal amplitude in all the stations and scenarios. Another scenario was performed considering sea level rise, and the results showed the higher increase occurring in the stations located in the internal regions of the Paranagua Estuarine Complex.

Few studies have explored climate extremes and their sectoral implications. This study evaluates future scenarios of extreme climate indices from the list of the Expert Team on Sector-specific Climate Indices (ET-SCI) and their sectoral implications in the Karnali Basin in western Nepal. First, future projections of 26 climate indices relevant to six climate-sensitive sectors in Karnali are made for the near (2021-2045), mid (2046-2070), and far (2071-2095) future for low- and high-emission scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively) using bias-corrected ensembles of 19 regional climate models from the COordinated Regional Downscaling EXperiment for South Asia (CORDEX-SA). Second, a qualitative analysis based on expert interviews and a literature review on the impact of the projected climate extremes on the climate-sensitive sectors is undertaken. Both the temperature and precipitation patterns are projected to deviate significantly from the historical reference already from the near future with increased occurrences of extreme events. Winter in the highlands is expected to become warmer and dryer. The hot and wet tropical summer in the lowlands will become hotter with longer warm spells and fewer cold days. Low-intensity precipitation events will decline, but the magnitude and frequency of extreme precipitation events will increase. The compounding effects of the increase in extreme temperature and precipitation events will have largely negative implications for the six climate-sensitive sectors considered here.","2021-09","2023-09-26 16:12:56","2023-09-26 16:12:56","","","","1-2","168","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000697070800001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;11<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;11<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;68</p>","","","TRENDS; PRECIPITATION; IMPACTS; MANAGEMENT; WATER; AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY; Nepal; Climate change impacts; Climate extremes; ClimPACT2; ET-SCI; HIMALAYAS; HYDROLOGICAL REGIME; Karnali; KOSHI RIVER-BASIN","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although adverse health impacts from extreme events declined over the past few decades, climate change and more people moving into harm's way could alter this trend. Long-term changes to Earth's energy balance are increasing the frequency and intensity of many extreme events and the probability of compound events, with trends projected to accelerate under certain greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. While most of these events cannot be completely avoided, many of the health risks could be prevented through building climate-resilient health systems with improved risk reduction, preparation, response, and recovery.

The present study aimed to use an integration of phylogeographical and species distribution modeling (SDM) approaches to provide new insights into the evolutionary history of the species throughout Quaternary climate oscillations. The phylogeographical analysis was followed by analyzing two mitochondrial DNA (mt-DNA) markers including 127 control region (D-loop) and 72 NADH dehydrogenase 2 (ND2) sequences from 15 populations in the entire species range that were obtained from GenBank. Potential recent and past distribution (the Last Glacial Maximum, LGM, 21 Kya and the Mid-Holocene, 6 Kya) reconstructed by ensemble SDM using nine algorithms with CCSM4, MIROC-ESM, and MPI-ESM-P models. N. kaiseri displayed two distinct lineages in the northern and southern regions that diverged in the Early-Pleistocene. The demographics analysis showed signs of a slight increase in effective population size for both northern and southern populations in the Mid-Pleistocene. Biogeography analysis showed that both vicariance and dispersal events played an important role in the formation of recent species distribution of N. kaiseri. Based on SDM projection onto paleoclimatic data, N. kaiseri displayed a scenario of past range expansion that followed by postglacial contraction. The models showed that the distribution range of the species may have shifted to a lower altitude during LGM while with amelioration of climatic during Mid-Holocene to recent conditions caused the species to shift to the higher altitude. The findings of the current study support the hypothesis that the Zagros mountains may be acting as climatic refugia and play an important role in the protection of isolated populations during climate oscillations.","2021-06","2023-09-26 16:12:56","2023-09-26 16:12:56","","7622-7633","","12","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000645979800001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;11<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;11<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;84</p>","","","climate change; CLIMATE-CHANGE; conservation; CAUDATA; climate refugia; amphibian; BIOGEOGRAPHY; FAMILY SALAMANDRIDAE AMPHIBIA; GENUS NEURERGUS; GLACIAL REFUGIA; IRAN; MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; Neurergus kaiseri; PHYLOGENETICS; SEQUENCE-ANALYSIS; Zagros mountain","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper examines how climate policies in these two arenas are related and to what extent domestic and international climate ambitions are complementary or disparate. While scholarly work has begun to assess the variation in overall climate policy ambition, only a few studies to date have tried to explain whether internationally ambitious countries are ambitious at home and vice versa. According to the common view, countries that are more ambitious at home can also be expected to be more ambitious abroad. Many scholars, however, portray the relationship instead as disparate, whereby countries need to walk a tightrope between the demands of their domestic constituencies on the one hand and international pressures on the other, while preferring the former over the latter. This study uses quantitative methods and employs data from the OECD DAC dataset on climate finance to measure international climate ambitions. Overall, the present work makes two major contributions. First, it provides evidence that international climate financing ambition is complementary to domestic climate ambition. Second, the article identifies the conditional effect of domestic ambition-with regard to responsibility, vulnerability, carbon-intensive industry and economic capacity-on international climate ambition.","2022-03","2023-09-26 16:12:56","2023-09-26 16:12:56","","97-118","","1","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000666826200001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;76</p>","","","Climate change; VULNERABILITY; Climate policy; POLITICS; GOVERNANCE; COUNTRIES; AID; ALLOCATION; Environmental politics; FINANCE; International relations; Quantitative research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The current study aims at documenting lessons learnt from this multi-partner process of integrating CC adaptation (CCA) into the NWS. The integration process was done using the climate proofing tool, an approach based on evidence of the vulnerability of water resources to CC.

The changes are investigated on the basis of historical and modelled data sets of daily precipitation. The historical observation data were recorded at 18 synoptic weather stations in Central Serbia and modelled data were extracted from the regional climate model EBU-POM (Eta Belgrade University-Princeton Ocean Model) under the A1B scenario. The average number of days in a year with precipition >= 20, 30, 40 and 50 mm (R20, R30, R40 and R50), the share of daily precipitation above the 20, 30, 40 and 50 mm (P20, P30, P40, P50) in the total annual precipitation and the monthly distribution of these heavy daily precipitation are used as indices of changes in extreme precipitation. These indices, for the three periods 2011-2040, 2041-2070 and 2071-2100, are determined and compared with those obtained for the historical reference period 1961-1990. The results have shown that the main changes in extreme precipitation in Central Serbia will be in their spatial distribution, and the uncertainty of the occurrence of extreme events will decrease. In the future the increase will be more pronounced than the decrease of these indices. We strongly emphasize the benefit of this paper for both the prevention of natural disasters in the study area and for the improvement of the regional climate model.","2021-06","2023-09-26 16:12:56","2023-09-26 16:12:56","","196-208","","2","69","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000655253300007","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;36</p>","","","SIMULATIONS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; REGIMES; Regional climate model; Climate changes; Central Serbia; Future extreme precipitation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Rising temperatures and changes in relative humidity and precipitation pose threats to nature-based and adventure tourism in Namibia. The mean annual TCI scores for the period 2008-2018 vary from classifications of 'good' for Etosha Safari at 62 to 'excellent' for Windhoek at 80. Monthly scores reveal a bimodal-shoulder and winter peak, indicating that the most suitable climatic conditions for tourism occur during the austral spring, autumn and winter months. This is consistent with the literature regarding peak tourist seasons, and fortuitously aligns with school holidays.

To face these challenges Italian Metropolitan Cities can play a fundamental role in helping municipalities to plan and coordinate their efforts. The process in the Venetian territory has lasted many years and it has led to the awareness that local adaptation policies need to be addressed with broader support. The Metropolitan City of Venice has constructed a methodology for the planning of climatic adaptation. This methodology has been developed thanks to various plans and projects. These projects acted to increase the coordination between bodies, to define a broad area vision, to help municipalities to implement local actions.

This study aimed at evaluating the effect of water salinity on the emergence and seedling growth of five Italian barnyardgrass [Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) P. Beauv.] populations (three sensitive and two resistant to acetolactate synthase-inhibiting herbicides), three Italian weedy rice (Oryza sativa L.) populations (all sensitive to imazamox), and two rice varieties (the conventional 'Baldo' variety and the imazamox-tolerant 'CL80' one). In 2017, seeds were sown in alveolar trays filled with sand, a nutrient solution, and water with the following salt concentrations: 0, 50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 mM NaCl. Plant emergence (after 15 d), plant height, shoot and root weight, chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and carotenoid content were measured at 40 d after sowing. Echinochloa crus-galli showed a higher tolerance to salinity than O. sativa and rice. All species were affected more at the seedling stage than at emergence. A variable behavior of the herbicide-resistant populations was shown; one resistant E. crus-galli population was affected more by salinity and showed a lower emergence rate (about 20% against 40% emergence of the other populations at the highest salt concentration) and reduced seedling growth, while the other resistant population's response was similar to that of the sensitive populations. The chlorophyll content increased as the salt content increased in all E. crus-galli populations. The highest emergence and growth reduction in O. sativa were recorded in the imazamox-tolerant rice. Rice and O. sativa were able to grow only up to 50 mM. Echinochloa crus-galli populations are probably favored under saline conditions, while lower infestation by O. sativa can be expected.","2021-01","2023-09-26 16:12:56","2023-09-26 16:12:56","","39-51","","1","69","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000616721400005","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;66</p>","","","Climate change; RESPONSES; GROWTH; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; PLANTS; GERMINATION; EBRO VALLEY; FITNESS COSTS; herbicide resistance; ION ACCUMULATION; RESISTANT; SALT STRESS; weed growth","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using a model of convergence, stasis and reverberation, this article positions these developments historically and politically. In it, I argue that Guyana???s shifting fortunes are reflective of broader regional and international shifts and contestations around post-colonial development and climate policy. The article shows how different forms of vulnerability coalesced over time to position Guyana as both vulnerable and as agential. The state???s vulnerability lies in its susceptibility to natural disasters through climate change, imperialism in the wake of colonialism, and ethnic strife through race-based politics. Its agency, on the other hand, lies in its deployment of its natural resources and its geographic location to negotiate changing geo-political arrangements and efforts to address climate change. In developing this argument, the article views, and positions Guyana as a microcosm of several pressing and overlapping global crises ??? a metaphorical eye of the storm.","2021","2023-09-26 16:12:56","2023-09-26 16:12:56","","333-354","","2","42","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000835277400001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;53</p>","","","Development; Climate Change; Colonialism; Convergence; Guyana","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Knowledge about these issues and preventive measures can affect the incidence and outbreak risk of dengue. Therefore, the present study was conducted to determine the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) among urban and rural communities and government officials about climate change and dengue in Laos and Thailand. Methods: A cross-sectional KAP survey about climate change and dengue were conducted in 360 households in Laos (180 urban and 180 rural), 359 households in Thailand (179 urban and 180 rural), and 20 government officials (10 in each country) using structured questionnaires. Data analysis was undertaken using descriptive methods, principal component analysis (PCA), Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test (as appropriate), and logistic regression. Results: Significant differences among the selected communities in both countries were found in terms of household participant's age, level of education, socioeconomic status, attitude level of climate change and KAP level of dengue (P < 0.05; 95% CI). Overall, participants' KAP about climate change and dengue were low except the attitude level for dengue in both countries. The level of awareness among government officials regarding the climatic relationship with dengue was also low. In Lao households, participants' knowledge about climate change and dengue was significantly associated with the level of education and socioeconomic status (SES) (P < 0.01). Their attitudes towards climate change and dengue were associated with educational level and internet use (P < 0.05). Householders' climate change related practices were associated with SES (P < 0.01) and dengue related practices were associated with educational level, SES, previous dengue experience and internet use (P < 0.01).

It is thus imperative to identify agro-climate wise, area-specific adaptation options to ensure food security. This study, therefore, evaluated some feasible adaptation options for two staple food grain crops, rice and wheat, in different agro-climatic regions (ACRs) of Eastern India. Alteration in transplanting date, seedling age, and fertilizer management (rate and split of fertilizer) for rice; and sowing date, fertilizer management, and deficit irrigation scheduling for wheat, are assessed as adaptation options. Crop environment and resource synthesis (DSSAT) model is used to simulate the crop yield using different plausible adaptation options to projected climate scenarios. Findings show that shifting transplanting/sowing date, and nitrogen fertilizer application at 120% of recommended nitrogen dose with four splits could be an effective adaptation for rice and wheat crops. Results also emphasize that transplanting of 18 days older seedlings may be beneficial in rice cultivation. In contrast, irrigation at a 30-40% deficit of maximum available water would sustain the wheat yield under climate change conditions.

While in laboratory conditions silicate minerals dissolution rates are well characterized, in field conditions the rate of the dissolution reaction is more difficult to predict, not least because it interacts with soil, plant, and hydrologic processes. Here we present a dynamic mass balance model connecting biogeochemical and ecohydrological dynamics to shed light on these intertwined processes involved in EW. We focus on the silicate mineral olivine, for its faster laboratory dissolution rate, and pay particular attention to understanding the role of plants and hydrological fluctuations and their propagation into soil biogeochemical processes (including cation exchange) and EW dynamics. A companion paper Cipolla et al.(2021) presents specific applications with the main purpose of understanding the carbon sequestration potential under different climate scenarios.","2021-08","2023-09-26 16:12:55","2023-09-26 16:12:55","","","","","154","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000677675600008","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;11<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;11<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;37</p>","","","Climate change; WATER; TRANSPORT; Carbon sequestration; Enhanced weathering; NITROGEN CYCLES; SILICATE MINERALS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ambient heatwaves accompanied by unusual droughts are major threats to poverty eradication in Tanzania. Due to sparsity of observation data and proper heatwave detection metrics, there has been a paucity of knowledge about heatwave events in Tanzania. In this study, the Heatwave Magnitude Index daily (HWMId) was adopted to quantitatively analyze heatwave characteristics throughout Tanzania at mid-21st century (2041-2070) and end of 21st century (2071-2100), relative to the reference period (1983-2012) using the CHIRTS-daily quasi-global high-resolution temperature dataset and climate simulations from a multi-modal ensemble of median scenarios (RCP4.5, from CORDEX-Africa). The results showed that moderate to super-extreme heatwaves occurred in Tanzania between 1983 and 2012, particularly in 1999, when ultra-extreme heatwaves (HWMId > 32) occurred in the Lake Victoria basin. It is projected that by mid-21st century, the upper category of HWMId would be hotter and longer, and would occur routinely in Tanzania. The spatial extent of all of the HWMId categories is projected to range from 34% to 73% by the end of the 21st century with a duration of 8 to 35 days, compared to 1 to 5 days during the reference period. These findings will contribute to increasing public awareness of the need for adaptation.","2021-08","2023-09-26 16:12:55","2023-09-26 16:12:55","","","","8","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000689083200001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;92</p>","","","AFRICA; climate change; Tanzania; TEMPERATURE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; IMPACT; RISK; MORTALITY; STRESS; ENSEMBLE; SUMMER; HEAT WAVES; CHIRTS; heatwaves; HWMId","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The regional climate model, the Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) regional climate model RegCM4, is driven by five different global climate models, CSIRO-Mk3-6-0, EC-EARTH, HadGEM2-ES, MPI-ESM-MR and NorESM1-M, at a grid spacing of 25 km under the representative concentration pathway RCP4.5. These global climate models were selected because of their high horizontal resolution and their good performance in reproducing temperature and precipitation over China. The model configuration used was customized for better performance over China. Bias correction was applied to the simulated temperature and precipitation before calculating the climate types. By the end of the 21st century (2069-2098), the annual mean temperature over China is projected to increase by 2.4 degrees C relatives to the present day (1981-2010) annual mean temperature, with the greatest warming (> 2.8 degrees C) occurring in the Three Rivers Headwaters region. The annual mean precipitation change shows a general increase in most parts of China, except for a slight decrease (< 7%) in southwestern China. The increase is more pronounced over northwestern China. The distribution of climate types was well reproduced by the simulations. A subtropical humid (Cr) climate mainly covers the regions south of the Yangtze River over eastern China. Southwestern China is dominated by a subtropical winter dry (Cw) climate. The Tibetan Plateau is mostly described as tundra (FT) and arid (type B) climate. Dry arid (BW) and semiarid (BS) climates cover most of the northern regions of 35 degrees N except over northeastern China, where temperate continental (Dc) and subarctic continental (Ec) climates exist. Compared to the present-day climates, a change of 22% in the climate types is projected to occur over the whole Chinese territory by the end of the 21st century. The changes are most significant over the Tibetan Plateau and along the climate transition zone of the Qinling Mountains-Huaihe River over China, with a dominant retreat of FT due to the profound warming and an expansion of BS and Cw being projected for the former, and a replacement of temperature oceanic (Do) by Cw being projected for the latter. Over northeastern China, the main projected change in the climate types is the replacement of Ec by Dc. Tropical wet-dry (Aw) climates will occur over all of Hainan Island. The analysis showed that most changes in climate types are driven by temperature rather than precipitation. For the national shelter zones, climate types will change by 24% over all the areas. Profound changes of similar to 40% will occur in the shelter zones of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the Sichuan-Yunnan-Loess Plateau, followed by those in the northeastern forest. More specifically, over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the replacement of FT by subarctic oceanic (Eo), BS, Ec, and Dc climates is projected to occur. While FT (62%) and BS (26%) dominate this region currently day, BS (38%) and FT (24%) will account for a greater proportion of the region by the end of the 21st century. The change in climate types on the Sichuan-Yunnan-Loess Plateau is characterized by the expansion of Cw and BS and a loss of FT. Replacement of Ec by Dc is projected in the northeastern forest shelter zone, indicating a major retreat of subarctic coniferous forest there. Greater ecological vulnerability and risks in the future under climate change are expected in the zones. Generally, the changes are in good agreement among the individual simulations, indicating a small uncertainty in the projections.","2022","2023-09-26 16:12:55","2023-09-26 16:12:55","","99-112","","1","67","","","","","","","","","","Chinese","","","","WOS:000747487400014","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;73</p>","","","climate change; CLASSIFICATION; MODEL; SIMULATION; SYSTEM; 21ST-CENTURY; ENSEMBLE; regional climate model; RESOLUTION; REGCM4; MULTIMODEL; Koppen climate types; MONSOON PRECIPITATION; national ecological security shelter zones","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The selection of proper methods for estimating snow fraction is thus essential. Two temperature-based and two humidity-based approaches to discriminate precipitation phase were evaluated using daily meteorological observations over the past six decades in Xinjiang in arid northwest China. The main findings included that 1) the finest discrimination was achieved by the wet-bulb temperature (T-w) method whereas the single temperature threshold at 0 degrees C produces the poorest result; the performances of the Dai and humidity-dependent empirical method (T-RH) methods were between them, with slightly lower error using the Dai method. Also, the T-w method is the least sensitive to regional heterogeneity and less affected by distinct changes in elevation; the other three methods, however, are biased mostly toward underestimating snow and show larger variations due to the regional discrepancies. Careful adjustment of snow discrimination thresholds based on the local properties of observation spots is needed for these methods. 2) Despite widespread warming, snow fraction perturbations in Xinjiang are characterized mainly by insignificant changes plus pronounced reductions at high mountain sites. Proxy drivers of such changes can be better explained by considering the hydrothermal diversity and changing climatic factors. Across the wetter subregions, snowfall has been significantly increasing, and the positive impact of which on snow fraction was hindered by significant warming, particularly in winter, and summer rainfall; across the drier subregions, however, insignificant change in snow fraction corresponds to a slow and insignificant increase in snowfall joined by the negative impacts of significant winter warming and summer rainfall.","2021-01","2023-09-26 16:12:55","2023-09-26 16:12:55","","353-369","","2","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000646373400007","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;78</p>","","","TEMPERATURE; TRENDS; VARIABILITY; Climate change; CHALLENGES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CENTRAL-ASIA; XINJIANG; Precipitation; Asia; SURFACE; Trends; Snow; PRECIPITATION PHASE; RAIN","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent successes of populist parties and politicians, especially in Europe and in the US, have given rise to extensive debates in the academic literature and beyond. Yet the link between populism and climate change scepticism (henceforth 'scepticism'), has so far received little attention. This paper examines the link between scepticism and populism by means of a unique dataset: a survey and detailed web browsing histories of participants from France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the US, and the UK. The web tracking data includes more than 150 million website visits over a period of three months and the survey contains questions about political attitudes and attitudes towards climate change. We analyse the 8893 websites which contained 'climate change' and its cognates in the URLs and link these website visits and the content of these websites to the political attitudes and climate change orientation of those who visited them. The contribution is both methodological (linking surveys and web tracking data, including cross-country comparison) and substantive (uncovering links between populists, their climate change orientations, and the content of related websites they visited). Our analysis demonstrates the value of computational methods in political communication research and provides insights into the link between populists and climate change scepticism.","2022-07-27","2023-09-26 16:12:55","2023-09-26 16:12:55","","1400-1439","","10","25","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000605675300001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;20<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;20<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;32</p>","","","Climate change; populism; survey; web tracking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The capacity of crops to dynamically adjust physiological processes (i.e., acclimate) to warming might improve overall performance. Understanding and quantifying the degree of acclimation in field crops could ensure better parameterization of crop and Earth System models and predictions of crop performance. We hypothesized that for field-grown wheat, when measured at a common temperature (25 degrees C), crops grown under warmer conditions would exhibit acclimation, leading to enhanced crop performance and yield. Acclimation was defined as (a) decreased rates of net photosynthesis at 25 degrees C (A(25)) coupled with lower maximum carboxylation capacity (V-cmax(25)), (b) reduced leaf dark respiration at 25 degrees C (both in terms of O-2 consumption R-dark_O-2(25) and CO2 efflux R-dark_CO225) and (c) lower R-dark_CO225 to V-cmax(25) ratio. Field experiments were conducted over two seasons with 20 wheat genotypes, sown at three different planting dates, to test these hypotheses. Leaf-level CO2-based traits (A(25), R-dark_CO225 and V-cmax(25)) did not show the classic acclimation responses that we hypothesized; by contrast, the hypothesized changes in Rdark_O2 were observed. These findings have implications for predictive crop models that assume similar temperature response among these physiological processes and for predictions of crop performance in a future warmer world.","2021-07","2023-09-26 16:12:55","2023-09-26 16:12:55","","2331-2346","","7","44","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000606486500001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;14<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;15<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;98</p>","","","climate change; CLIMATE-CHANGE; WINTER-WHEAT; heat stress; NITROGEN; dark respiration; DARK RESPIRATION; PLANT RESPIRATION; PROTEIN-DEGRADATION; Q(10) VALUES; TEMPERATURE RESPONSES; TERRESTRIAL BIOSPHERE; THERMAL-ACCLIMATION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to explore the current global potential cultivation areas of soybean and its future dynamics (in 2030s, 2050s and 2070s) in response to future climate changes, a MaxEnt model was established. Based on fraction values of soybean-harvested area (FSHA) as the currently known soybean distribution, and climate and soil conditions as the predictors, predictions with a resolution of 5 arcmin (approx. 10 x 10 km) were made by our model. The modeling results indicated that most of the current global soybean distributed in areas with medium to high land suitability for soybean cultivation, and there were still potential undeveloped suitable areas around the world. Under future climate change scenarios (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) of multiple global circulation models (IPSL-CM5A-LR, BCC-CSM 1.1 and MIROC-ESM-CHEM), significant increase in suitability was expected to occur in broad areas of the middle and high latitudes of the northern hemisphere. Areas of central and eastern Europe, southern Russia and southeastern Canada were expected to get a medium suitability in the long term. Both the area with increasing and decreasing land suitability were predicted to increase with time, but the latter was greater and RCP 8.5 gave the worst prediction. Large areas of low latitudes were expected to become unsuitable under future climate change scenarios.

Recent projections of LDD in the Mediterranean region indicate a gradual widening of arid areas due to increased aridity and global warming by the end of the 21st century. Therefore, this study used the MEDALUS method to identify sensitivity to LDD in Western Serbia between 1986 and 2005 and to assess possible effects of climate change (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios) on land degradation processes by the end of the 21st century. Likewise, analysis of possible major drivers of degradation was conducted using principal component analysis (PCA) and multiple linear regression analysis (MLRA). The study revealed that degradation processes in the study area were found to be most influenced by anthropogenic drivers (34.4%), less so by natural/anthropogenic ones (23.5%), and least by natural factors (20.1%). Results also showed that critical areas of LDD susceptibility account for nearly 37% of the study area, transitional areas cover 35%, while 27% constitutes potentially safe areas. Additionally, critical areas were projected to expand by 33.6% (RCP4.5) and 51.7% (RCP8.5) by 2100 as a result of predicted temperature increases and a reduction in precipitation in the study area. This study also revealed that the Standardised Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) better explains the impact of climate change on LDD than other indices, bearing in mind the capacity of this index to detect temporal oscillations in drought in the context of climate change, and it is therefore a reliable climate parameter for this method.","2021-04","2023-09-26 16:12:55","2023-09-26 16:12:55","","","","","123","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000615921800003","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;15<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;16<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;98</p>","","","Climate change; SPEI; Drivers; LDD; MEDALUS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study was conducted to further establish this method for the investigation of allergenic pollen from tree species (hazel, alder, and birch). Direct comparison under outdoor conditions revealed that the cut twigs compared to donor trees were similar in the timing of flowering and the amount of pollen produced. Cut twigs were able to flower in climate chambers and produced a sufficient amount of pollen for subsequent laboratory analysis. The addition of different plant or tissue fertilizers in the irrigation of the twigs did not have any influence; rather, the regular exchange of water and the usage of fungicide were sufficient for reaching the stage of flowering. In the experimental setup, the twigs were cut in different intervals before the actual flowering and were put under warming conditions in the climate chamber. An impact of warming on the timing of flowering/pollen characteristics could be seen for the investigated species. Therefore, the twig method is well applicable for experimental settings in pollen research simulating, e.g., accelerated warming under climate change.","2021-11","2023-09-26 16:12:55","2023-09-26 16:12:55","","1983-1993","","11","65","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000655453300001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;45</p>","","","Climate change; CLIMATE-CHANGE; IMPACTS; GROWTH; Allergy; BET V 1; BIRCH; PARTICLES; PHENOLOGICAL RESPONSES; PHOTOPERIOD; Pollen; SEASON; Twig experiment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nevertheless, aquaculture in Bangladesh has faced recent concerns due to climate change. Aquaculture is vulnerable to a combination of climatic factors, such as global warming, rainfall variation, flood, drought, temperature fluctuation, and salinity change. Considering the vulnerability of fish production to the impacts of climate change, tilapia farming is one of the possible strategies for adaptation to climate change. The positive culture attributes of tilapia are their tolerance to low water levels and poor water quality with rainfall variation, temperature fluctuation, and salinity change. In fact, tilapia farming is possible in a wide range of water environments, including freshwater, brackish water, and saltwater conditions. We suggest that appropriate tilapia culture strategies with institutional support and collaboration with key stakeholders are needed for adaptation to environmental change.","2021-07","2023-09-26 16:12:54","2023-09-26 16:12:54","","","","14","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000676912600001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;14<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;15<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;173</p>","","","climate change; adaptation; environment; aquaculture; CYPRINUS-CARPIO L.; FATTY-ACID-COMPOSITION; GROWTH-PERFORMANCE; LOW-TEMPERATURE STRESS; NILE TILAPIA; NONSPECIFIC IMMUNE-RESPONSE; OREOCHROMIS-NILOTICUS L.; PRAWN MACROBRACHIUM-ROSENBERGII; REARING MOZAMBIQUE TILAPIA; RICE-FISH CULTURE; tilapia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The well-recognized importance of dust-associated microorganisms contrasts starkly with our limited understanding of the factors determining the variation in the composition of these communities at the global scale. Here, we provide the first insight into the global determinants of dust-associated microorganisms by quantifying the environmental factors shaping bacterial and fungal community composition in 467 outdoor settled dust samples collected from 33 countries and 6 continents. Our results show that the global variation in dust-associated bacterial and fungal community composition was, to some degree, predictable from mean annual precipitation and temperature. Notably, our results show that the fungal genera Alternaria and Aspergillus, which contain many species that can serve as triggers of allergenic disease in humans and as plant pathogens, were more abundant in drier regions. Collectively, these results highlight the key influence of climate on the global distribution of dust-associated microorganisms and provide the baseline information needed to build a more comprehensive understanding of how microbial exposures vary across the globe and in response to climate change. IMPORTANCE A broad diversity of microorganisms can be found in dust, with some of these microorganisms capable of causing allergenic disease in human via inhalation or affecting plant health by acting as plant pathogens. However, the spatial variation in dust microbiomes and the environmental factors associated with this variation have not been comprehensively assessed at the global scale. Here, we investigated the bacteria and fungi found in outdoor settled dust samples spanning 33 countries and 6 continents. Our results show that dust-associated bacteria and fungi exhibit climate-driven variability in community composition at the global scale. Our results call for the development of strategies to predict the geographic distribution of dust-associated microorganisms and to identify the potential associations between microbial exposures and the health of humans, animals, and plants.","2021-10","2023-09-26 16:12:54","2023-09-26 16:12:54","","","","2","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000728629300180","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;60</p>","","","climate change; VARIABILITY; URBAN; EXPOSURE; DISTRIBUTIONS; DATABASE; aerobiology; AIRBORNE BACTERIAL COMMUNITIES; allergens; DESERT DUST; dust microbiomes; FUNGAL SPORES; INDOOR; OUTDOOR AIR","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The LARS-WG6 model was employed to simulate the meteorological data obtained from Rasht Meteorological Station under the RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 scenarios for the 2020-2050 and 2060-2090 periods. The simulated values were assessed based on the measured values of total biomass and grain yields using the coefficient of determination (R-2), the relative error parameters, and the normalized root mean square error (RMSEn). The calculated values of RMSE. varied from 7 to 4% for grain yield and from 3 to 7% for biomass yield at the calibration and validation stages, respectively. The results suggested that the AquaCrop model had suitable accuracy in predicting biomass and grain yields. The findings indicate that climate change decreased mean rice grain yield by 17 to 23% under the RCP4.5 scenario and by 18 to 23% under the RCP8.5 scenario for 2050 and 2090, respectively, in non-flooded irrigation management. The lowest simulated mean biomass and grain yields were obtained under irrigation at 11-day intervals in scenario RCP8.5 for the second future period (2060-2090). In general, non-flooded irrigation management had negative effects on rice grain yield under climate change. Moreover, the mean rice growing period under both RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 scenarios declined by 2090. These findings can be used for a broad spectrum of users such as farmers, agricultural engineers, and project managers in practical policymaking and making correct decisions compatible with the region in order to increase rice grain yield productivity under future climate conditions in northern Iran.","2022","2023-09-26 16:12:54","2023-09-26 16:12:54","","","","","39","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000797195000010","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;41</p>","","","climate change; TEMPERATURE; yield; FIELD; CHINA; SYSTEMS; rice; AquaCrop; AQUACROP MODEL; FAO CROP MODEL; irrigation; ORYZA2000; SIMULATE YIELD RESPONSE; SONGKHRAM RIVER-BASIN","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many economics, environmental studies, and public policy departments now offer climate economics and climate policy courses, but it is unclear what topics are covered, what resources are used, and with what knowledge students are expected to walk away. In this paper, we assess what topics are (or should be) taught in climate economics courses, how those topics have shifted over time, and what learning goals are articulated for students. Our assessment is based on a review of common teaching materials, an informal collection of syllabi, and the results from a survey of environmental and resource economists. Overall, there is a reasonable degree of consensus on the key topics for inclusion across survey respondents, although some topics may complement or crowd out those in standard courses in environmental and resource economics. Despite relatively broad consensus on topics, we find that climate economics courses can diverge greatly in practice, perhaps because there is no central teaching resource used across courses. We conclude constructively by proposing a set of learning goals that instructors can draw from and build upon, which we hope will aid in developing shared expectations for what students will learn in a climate economics course.","2021","2023-09-26 16:12:54","2023-09-26 16:12:54","","203-233","","3","15","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000702127500002","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;31</p>","","","Climate change; CAP; CLASSROOM GAME; climate economics; economic education; environmental economics; learning goals; PERMITS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the nature of climate change resilience is widely debated in the literature, and there is a knowledge gap regarding the best way to address adaptation at the interface with development objectives as part of mainstreaming. This paper aims to address this knowledge gap via a case study of a community-based, Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) project in Vietnam. A case study approach was applied with fieldwork at one project site, complemented by semi-structured interviews with government stakeholders, key experts, and project leaders of related projects. The analysis identifies five key factors that enhance rural resilience in a smallholder agricultural context: (i) engaging local governments as partners, (ii) considering broader landscape issues such as markets, (iii) providing farmers with support to facilitate adoption of CSA practices, (iv) fostering community capacity building, and (v) promoting adaptive management and scenario planning to deal with uncertainty. The paper concludes that resilience is multidimensional and not solely in line with any one of the approaches dominant in the literature.","2021-10","2023-09-26 16:12:54","2023-09-26 16:12:54","","","","10","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000712697200001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;46</p>","","","resilience; AGRICULTURE; climate change adaptation; adaptive capacity; climate-smart agriculture; climate-smart villages; mainstreaming","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The results show that there are 988 glaciers in total in the basin, with a total area of 560 km(2) and average area of 0.57 km(2) for a single glacier. The area and number of the glaciers oriented north and northeast are 205 km(2) (327 glaciers) and 180 km(2) (265 glaciers), respectively. The glaciers are categorized into eight classes as per their area, which are less than 0.1, 0.1-0.5, 0.5-1.0, 1.0-2.0, 2.0-5.0, 5.0-10.0, 10.0-20.0, and greater than 20.0 km(2), respectively. The smaller glaciers between 0.1 km(2) and 10.0 km(2) account for 509 km(2) or 91% in total area, and, in particular, the glaciers smaller than 0.5 km(2) account for 74% in the total number. The glacial area is concentrated at 3500-4000 m in altitude (512 km(2) or 91.4% in total). The number of glaciers in the basin decreased by 10.5% or 116, and their area decreased by 263.29 km(2) (-4.79 km(2) a(-1)) or 32% (-0.58% a(-1)) from 1964 to 2019; the glaciers with an area between 2.0 km(2) and 5.0 km(2) decreased by the largest, -82.60 km(2) or -40.67% in the total area at -1.50 km(2) a(-1) or -0.74% a(-1)), and the largest decrease in number (i.e., 126 glaciers) occurs between 0.1 km(2) and 0.5 km(2). The total ice storage in the basin decreased by 97.84-153.22 km(3) from 1964 to 2019, equivalent to 88.06-137.90 km(3) water (taking 0.9 g cm(-3) as ice mass density). The temperature increase rate in the basin was +0.37 degrees C decade(-1), while the precipitation was +13.61 mm decade(-1) during the last fifty-five years. This analysis shows that the increase in precipitation in the basin was not sufficient to compensate the mass loss of glaciers caused by the warming during the same period. The increase in temperature was the dominant factor exceeding precipitation mass supply for ruling the retreat of the glaciers in the entire basin.","2021-02","2023-09-26 16:12:54","2023-09-26 16:12:54","","","","3","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000615519600001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;56</p>","","","climate change; MOUNTAINS; DATABASE; climate response; decelerated-melting glaciers; Ebi Lake basin; RISE; TIEN-SHAN","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, these seasonal ecosystems provide an opportunity to examine how variability in climatic conditions affects the regeneration and quality of pasture vegetation. The intensity of grazing in this seasonal system can moderate, or alternatively exacerbate, climatic effects on the nutritional quality of the vegetation. Herein, we analyzed the interactive effects of climate variables, grazing intensity, and grazing exclusion on herbage quality parameters using long-term vegetation and climate data collected during 2005-2018 from an extensive experiment in Galilee, Israel. We evaluated the contribution of different climate variables to the prediction of herbage quality parameters. Our results showed that climate variables have a dramatic effect on herbage quality and that this effect interacts with grazing intensity. Herbage quality improved in temperate rainy years compared to warm and dry years. High grazing intensity improved herbage quality under temperate climate conditions, but this effect was moderated or completely disappeared as winter conditions become warmer and drier. The results of the study foresee negative effects of warming and drying on the carrying capacity of natural pastures.","2021-04","2023-09-26 16:12:54","2023-09-26 16:12:54","","","","4","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000642684800001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;53</p>","","","climate change; DROUGHT; VEGETATION; RESPONSES; PRODUCTIVITY; CHANGE IMPACTS; MANAGEMENT; Mediterranean climate; COMMUNITY; pasture; CARRYING-CAPACITY; digestibility; grassland; grazing intensity; MEDITERRANEAN RANGELANDS; protein; REORGANIZATION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As income is a key determinant of ecological impacts, the Global North-and wealthier classes elsewhere-are the primary drivers of global carbon emissions, while the least well off have contributed the least yet are set to be hit hardest by climate impacts. These inequalities are clearly unjust, but the interrelations between economic inequality and ecological impacts are complex, leaving open the question of whether reducing the former would mitigate the latter, in the absence of reductions in total economic output. Here, we contribute to these debates by estimating the carbon-footprint implications of reducing income (and hence expenditure) inequalities within 32 countries of the Global North to the levels people consider to be fair; levels that are substantially smaller than currently exist. We find that realising these levels of economic inequality brings comparable reductions in carbon-footprint inequalities. However, in isolation, implementing fair inequalities has a negligible impact upon total emissions. In contrast, recomposing consumption-by reducing inequalities in household expenditure and the overall levels, then reallocating the reductions to public services-reduces carbon footprint by up to 30% in individual countries and 16% overall and, crucially, still allows the consumption of those at the bottom to rise. Such reductions could be significant on a global level, and they would be additional to the full range of conventional technological and demand-side measures to reduce carbon emissions.","2021-03","2023-09-26 16:12:54","2023-09-26 16:12:54","","","","3","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000618342100001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;10<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;10<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;65</p>","","","climate change; IMPACTS; PREFERENCES; climate justice; poverty; inequality; TRADE; CARBON EMISSIONS; energy consumption; fairness; FOOTPRINTS; meritocracy; PARADOX; RELATIVE INCOME","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is important because explicitly considering positive externalities has not to our knowledge been done in the climate ethics literature. Specifically, it is argued that those who enjoy passive gains from climate change owe gains not to the net losers, but to the emitters, just as the emitters owe compensation to the net losers for the negative externality. This is defended by appeal to theoretical virtues and to the social benefits of generating positive externalities, even when those positive externalities are coupled with far greater negative externalities.

Results and conclusions Changes in thermal conditions were demonstrated based on average air temperatures and the GDD index. There were no significant changes in atmospheric precipitation, showing a small periodicity of ten years, and no changes in monthly frequency with a deficit of precipitation (SPI analysis). It was demonstrated that changes in thermal conditions as well as the introduction of new maize varieties over fifty years significantly improved plant maturation, which resulted in a significant increase in grain weight. However, this did not affect the yield of maize for silage, neither in crop rotation nor in the monoculture system.","2021","2023-09-26 16:12:54","2023-09-26 16:12:54","","3-18","","1","20","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000681046500001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;23</p>","","","ADAPTATION; climate change; TEMPERATURE; PRECIPITATION; YIELD; maize; north-eastern Poland","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Alongside territories and communities, large infrastructures such as dams may be vulnerable to climate change and need to be resilient to related impacts. Consequently, their approval should require a comprehensive assessment of associated climate change risks. This concern is addressed by several international guidelines that suggest incorporating the evaluation of climate change risks in the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) process to overcome it. It is also evidenced in several national EIA regulations updated accordingly. Based on a systematic review of scientific literature published in the last twenty years, this paper explores how has the scientific community addressed the integration of climate change risks in the EIA of dams. The findings show that the potential of EIA to address climate change risks is widely acknowledged. However, published systematic studies assessing how the analysis of these risks is being included in dams' EIA current practice, are rare. This gap suggests a research potential around the topic and a new niche for research.","2021-07-04","2023-09-26 16:12:53","2023-09-26 16:12:53","","277-289","","4","39","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000624719900001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;84</p>","","","Climate change; dams; environmental impact assessment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The conceptual framework used in this study has provided interconnections that influence beliefs and understandings in providing a knowledge base for making ""informed-decision"" among high school students. This study was conducted in three year 9 classes in two high schools in the UK and among 65 students. An inquiry intervention model was developed using the 5E instructional model (Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate, and Evaluate) to identify beliefs and understanding and to strengthen students' knowledge base. This study used a design-based research setting and utilised a mixed methodology. The Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were computed to examine the pre-post-difference among questionnaire items, and structural equation modelling (SEM) was utilised to explore the relationship between belief, understanding, and intention. Data analysis of the intervention revealed that students developed a strong understanding of the causes and effects of global warming. There is evidence that students used that knowledge to ""inform-decision"" in relation to global warming and climate change. Promoting informed decision-making through science teaching can encourage responsible action in the future. The real gap identified in this study is that the regular school curriculum does not engage socio-scientific issues in the real world and has no opportunity to organise an inquiry-based instructional sequence for informed decision-making.","2021-03","2023-09-26 16:12:53","2023-09-26 16:12:53","","166-185","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000616889200001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;13<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;13<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;76</p>","","","Climate change; FRAMEWORK; Global warming; SCIENCE; KNOWLEDGE; PATTERNS; YOUNG-PEOPLE; EDUCATION; SOCIOSCIENTIFIC ISSUES; ARGUMENTATION; EXPLANATION; Informed-decision; TEACHERS USE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, national policies on climate change mitigation and adaptation seem to narrow the potential contributions of the forest sector to climate protection targets. This is largely because of the divergence between the management goals of forests for climate protection, and products for both industries and livelihoods. This article uses discourse analysis as a methodological tool to analyze South Africa's climate and forest policies to identify the discourses shaping forest policy goals and mandates, and their integration into climate policy targets for forest-based climate change interventions. Four discourses, namely, preservation of forest integrity, social inclusiveness, equitable benefit sharing, and inclusive development of forests and forest-based communities, were identified as the dominant discourses influencing forest policy goals in South Africa. Their influence on forest management programmes has a mix of costs and benefits outcomes. For example, policy responses to the discourse on the preservation of forest integrity have resulted in ecologically sustainable forests in some cases and in other cases restricted the participation of local people in forest enterprise development. Additionally, climate policies recognized six possible interventions with respect to forest-based climate change mitigation and adaptation in South Africa but were silent about the four discourses shaping forest policy goals. Consequently, existing climate policies do not contain regulations to guide forest management for climate change mitigation and adaptation. We therefore recommend that forest-related goals in climate policy be grounded in the past experiences and lessons of forest policy implementations in order to take advantage of the synergies and reduce the trade-offs with respect to multipurpose management of forests for livelihoods, enterprise development, and climate change mitigation and adaptation.","2021-06","2023-09-26 16:12:53","2023-09-26 16:12:53","","168-181","","2","23","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000664420600004","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;70</p>","","","ADAPTATION; climate change; MITIGATION; adaptation; mitigation; sustainability; forestry; LAND; PRODUCTS; CLAIM; PROVINCE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It involves the relocation of retirees from richer countries of the global North to places in the world where the costs of living are lower. In contrast from most other migrants, these retirees do not generally relocate to find more work opportunities. Aeromobility, namely frequent air travel, is a key aspect of their ability to be geographically mobile, which social scientists often depict as reflecting the economic advantages and consumerist culture of a new generation of older people. In addition, some experts consider older people's carbon footprint to be particularly large due to their economic advantages and lack of ecological values (e.g., see Haq et al., 2010). The literature on retirement migration scarcely focuses on the role that aeromobility-particularly cheap flights-plays in retirement migrants' decision to relocate and their experiences after migration. Using the cases of retirement migrants in Spain and Costa Rica, this article aims to better understand why some retired citizens of richer countries engage in lifestyles based on high-frequency travel, particularly when their migration is driven by the search for more economic security. To answer this question, we argue that values alone do not sufficiently explain social practices and individual decision-making, including the seeming prioritisation of mobility over sustainability.","2021-08","2023-09-26 16:12:53","2023-09-26 16:12:53","","156-164","","","124","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000678501400006","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;77</p>","","","Climate change; Aeromobility; Ageing; CUENCA; Globalisation; Inequalities; LIFE-STYLE MIGRATION; TRANSNATIONALISM","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It was predicted that climatic warming would result in greater overlap of the geographic ranges of salmon species, and increased saffron cod mean length. Ichthyofaunal remains were derived from two archaeological sites spanning 2000 years representing four temporal periods. Global and regional paleo-climactic datasets were used to define broad climatic trends for each period. Vertebral width was measured to group archaeological salmon specimens into three categories: (1) pink (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) and sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka), (2) all salmon species, and (3) chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and chum (Oncorhynchus keta). Saffron cod premaxillae were measured to reconstruct total length at capture. During the onset and peak of the Little Ice Age (AD 1200s-1800s), mean salmon vertebral width was smaller, and size classes primarily represented pink/sockeye salmon, which supports observations that climatic fluctuations influence current and past salmon distributions. Saffron cod measurements suggested that fisheries primarily targeted spawning adult populations, while mean total length did not coincide with periods of warming or cooling. This paper demonstrates the applicability of morphometric methods in assessing past species ecological tolerance in northwestern Alaska and adds further resolution to zooarchaeological taxonomic abundance values.","2021-06","2023-09-26 16:12:53","2023-09-26 16:12:53","","","","6","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001028211100002","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;101</p>","","","Climate change; Fisheries; Alaska; Historical ecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Resupply of nutrients by upper ocean recycling is itself controlled by multiple biotic and abiotic factors. Although the response of these drivers to climate change will shape future recycling rates and their stoichiometry, their magnitude and variability are unaddressed by climate change projections, which means potentially important feedbacks on surface biogeochemistry are neglected. Here, we assess the impacts of climate change under the high emissions RCP8.5 scenario on the recycling of the essential micronutrients Fe, Zn, Cu, Co and Mn and quantify the regional control by zooplankton food quality, prey quantity, sea surface temperature and zooplankton biomass. A statistical assessment of our model results reveals that the variability in recycling fluxes across all micronutrients is mainly driven by the variability of zooplankton and prey biomass. In contrast, the variability in micronutrient recycling stoichiometry and its response to climate change are more complex and is regulated by zooplankton food quality and prey quantity. Regionally, the relative influence of each driver on recycling changes in our model by the end of the 21st century. Temperature becomes an important driving factor in the polar regions while the expansion of oligotrophic regions leads to the importance of food quality increase for low and mid-latitudes. These responses lead to novel feedbacks that can amplify the response of surface ocean biogeochemistry and alter nutrient deficiency regimes.","2021-10","2023-09-26 16:12:53","2023-09-26 16:12:53","","4758-4770","","19","27","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000678749200001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;7<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;7<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;59</p>","","","climate change; IMPACT; COMMUNITIES; OCEAN; CARBON; zooplankton; LIMITATION; PHYTOPLANKTON; ASSIMILATION; biogeochemistry; COPPER; IRON; micronutrients; NUTRIENT; recycling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Biogas technology has recently been described as one of the most promising solutions to the problems of deforestation, energy supply, and climate change. Therefore, this study was aimed to investigate the potential of biogas technology in fuelwood saving and carbon emission reduction in the Central Rift Valley of Ethiopia. A multi-stage sampling procedure was employed to select a sample of 192 households (HH) (68 biogas adopters and 124 non-adopters). To conduct the Kitchen efficiency test, 25 test subjects were chosen at random from each category. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and an independent-sample t-test. The energy source for cooking and heating were fuelwood, biogas, animal dung, agricultural residue, and charcoal were the most common energy source for domestic use, accounting for 46.9%, 35.4%, 9.4 %, 5.2 %, and 3.1%, respectively. Kerosene lamps, battery cells, and tiny solar panels were utilized by 35 %, 32.4 %, and 18 % of respondents, respectively, for lighting. The most widely used woody plants for domestic energy usage were Eucalyptus camaldulensis and Eucalyptus saligna, according to the findings. The digester size of 6m(3) was used in 93 (56.5%) of the 165 biogas plants, while 8m(3) and 10m(3) digesters were used in 69 (43.5%) and 3 (1.8%) of the plants, respectively. Hence, the annual fuelwood savings from using biogas technology per household was calculated to be 1856.78 kg per year, with an annual Carbon dioxide (CO2) emission reduction capacity of 2.75 tons per biogas plant. Consequently, it was projected that all functional biogas plants (111) would save around 305.25 tons of CO(2)e per year. Generally, Biogas has been proven to be a viable technique for reducing reliance on forest resources and mitigating climate change in general. As a result, the country's energy sector should encourage families to embrace biogas technology to enhance fuelwood availability and reduce carbon emissions.","2021-09","2023-09-26 16:12:53","2023-09-26 16:12:53","","","","9","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000703619900012","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;63</p>","","","Climate change; Households; Carbon; COUNTRIES; Biogas; Fuelwood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We tracked PMG from 2001 to 2017, focusing mostly upon the latest images from 2016-2017. PMG delivers about ca. 10(6) m(3) day(-1) of ice in the Lago Argentino, and its front periodically reaches the Peninsula Magallanes. Therein, the PMG causes an ice-dam, clogging Brazo Rico channel, and lifting water level by about 10 m, until ice-dam failure, normally occurring in March. Here, we used 36 pairs of satellite images with a resolution of 10 m (SENTINEL2, visible, 9 pairs of images) and 15 m (LANDSAT imagery, panchromatic, 27 pairs of images) to calculate surface velocity (V-S). We used Orientation Correlation technique, implemented via the ImGRAFT(R) TemplateMatch tool. Calving rates were then calculated with two methods, namely, (i) M1, by ice flow through the glacier front, and (ii) M2, by ice flow at 7.5 km upstream of the front minus ablation losses. Surface velocity ranged from about 4 m day(-1) in the accumulation area to about 2 m day(-1) in the calving front, but it is variable seasonally with maxima in the summer (December-January-February). Calving rate (CRM) ranges from 7.72 x 10(5) +/- 32% to 8.76 x 10(5) +/- 31% m(3) day(-1), in line with recent studies, also with maxima in the summer. We found slightly lower flow velocity and calving rates than previously published values, but our estimates cover a different period, and a generally large uncertainty in flow assessment suggests a recent overall stability of the glacier.","2022-01","2023-09-26 16:12:52","2023-09-26 16:12:52","","","","1","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000741772200001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;39</p>","","","climate change; DYNAMICS; LANDSAT; PATAGONIA; Patagonian glaciers; SENTINEL2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this study is to highlight the impact of droughts of different intensity and territorial expansion on the sunflower crop in the Republic of Moldova. For this, the data from the last twenty years were analyzed, regarding the area cultivated with sunflowers, the global production and the average yield in the administrative-territorial profile, as well as annual and semi-annual precipitation and temperatures. During the analyzed period, the global sunflower production in the Republic of Moldova registers general growth trends, explained, for the most part, by the constant increase of the cultivated area, but also due to the high productive and qualitative performance of the new hybrids introduced into the crop. The analysis of the relationship between precipitation and temperature, and the sunflower harvest, highlighted the temporal evolution of the parameters and the dependence of the sunflower yield on environmental factors, and the negative influence of the drought on the harvest. The years with the highest droughts had a significant impact on the average harvest per hectare, strongly affecting the yield of sunflowers and reducing it by about 50%. The sunflower harvest was closely related to the precipitation during the growing season and those in the cold half of the year and less to the amount of annual rainfall. In addition, the high temperatures associated with periods of precipitation deficit determined low yields.","2022","2023-09-26 16:12:52","2023-09-26 16:12:52","","","","4","50","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000905056000014","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;34</p>","","","climate change; CLIMATE-CHANGE; STRESS; temperature; drought; precipitation; sunflower","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examined how fire impacts ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi associated with Pinus ponderosa, an important tree species in western North America. In the biodiverse Madrean Sky Islands, P. ponderosa forests exist on insular mountains separated by arid lands. How do EM fungi in these isolated ranges respond to fire, and can data from individual ranges predict community shifts after fire at a regional scale? By comparing areas in two ranges that experienced moderate fires 12-16 y earlier, and proximate areas in each range without recent fire, we reveal pervasive effects on diversity and composition of EM communities more than a decade after moderate fires occurred. Post fire differences in EM communities in different ranges highlight the challenge of predicting fungal community shifts in these isolated forests, despite similarities of climate, plant communities, and fire severity.

Objective We describe a collaborative project to establish the Texas Flood Registry to track the health and housing impacts of major flooding events. Methods Those who enroll in the registry answer retrospective questions regarding the impact of storms on their health and housing status. We recruit both those who did and did not flood during storm events to enable key comparisons. We leverage partnerships with multiple local health departments, community groups, and media outlets to recruit broadly. We performed a preliminary analysis using multivariable logistic regression and a binomial Bayesian conditional autoregressive (CAR) spatial model. Results We find that those whose homes flooded, or who came into direct skin contact with flood water, are more likely to experience a series of self-reported health effects. Median household income is inversely related to adverse health effects, and spatial analysis provides important insights within the modeling approach.

Drawing on the literature documenting this in theory and practice, we present a comprehensive overview of climate change risks and considerations across the whole life cycle of a restoration initiative. The resulting framework identified seven areas of restoration design and implementation in which climate change is important to address: setting restoration objectives, selecting sites and managing connectivity, choosing target species and ecosystems, managing key ecosystem interactions and micro-climates, identifying and mitigating site-level climate change risks, aligning the project with long-term policies, and designing a monitoring framework that enables adaptive management. A scan of restoration projects focussing on two regions - Brazil and countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, ASEAN - revealed limited inclusion of these considerations in practice, with less than 5% of the projects evidently addressing at least one of the seven areas. We discuss two projects showing good practice in climate resilient restoration: restoration of Atlantic forest in Brazil that plans for climate change in connectivity and hydrological management, species selection, and policy alignment, and crayweed underwater forest restoration in Sydney, Australia, whose careful attention to species provenance, genotype measurement and monitoring provided a ""future-proofing"" approach to restoration success in the long term. Building on such examples, our framework can be used as a tool to support global restoration targets and the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration 2021-2030 through more climate resilient restoration.

Due to increasing human population forecasted, more than 9 billion by 2050, there is an increase in the food demand and consumption by whole population. The world as a whole is undergoing several transformative changes. Growing population,changing lifestyles, expanding urbanization and accelerated climate changes are forming novel challenges for the global livestock system. Day-by-day due to continuous changes in food consumption patterns, i.e. increased demand for cattle products, resulting from urbanisation, rising affluence, and nutritional and environmental concerns are influencing what we eat, who consumes it, and how much we eat more than ever before. The dual burdens of nutrition, i.e. either over consumption or malnutrition, along with the need to alleviate the climate change effects,are shaping research priorities, influencing policy, and changing people's perceptions of food in different ways.The livestock industry is a fast-paced industry. It is changing in developing nations as a result of the rapidly increasing demand for animal products. Demand for cattle products is stagnant in industrialised countries, while many production techniques are improving their efficiency and environmental sustainability. Human population expansion, wealth growth, and urbanisation have all influenced demand for products of livestock in the past, and the production response in various livestock systems has been linked to science and technology and rises in animal population. Rivalry for natural resources, notably land and water, as well as competition between food and feed,will progressively effect output in the future.

Previous studies have revealed positive effects of sea-surface temperature (SST) on phytoplankton in terms of chlorophyll a concentrations (Chla) in high latitude oceans, while negative effects prevail in tropical and midlatitude oceans as well as under stratified summer conditions at higher latitudes. Based on a global analysis of 20 years of ocean Chla and SST data, we first investigated how interannual variability in SST is associated with Chla for each month of the season for every ocean province. We then quantified how the SST-Chla relationships varied with the long-term average (baseline) SST. We found significant season-dependent SST effects on Chla in most ocean provinces. The signs and magnitudes of these effects were consistently associated with the baseline SST, with a shift from positive to negative effects of SST on Chla around 14 degrees C. Based on field observations and literature data, we also estimated the interaction between nitrate limitation and temperature on the SST-Chla relationship. Our findings suggest that the ocean warming effects on Chla depend consistently on the baseline temperature, both with regard to seasonal effects within regions and regional effects between high and low latitude provinces. Our analysis further suggests that the monthly 14 degrees C isotherms can be used as a first approximation to separate areas and seasons where warming has opposite signed effects.","2021-05","2023-09-26 16:12:52","2023-09-26 16:12:52","","","","5","35","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000655225100004","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;8<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;8<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;54</p>","","","climate change; VARIABILITY; MODEL; DRIVEN; PATTERNS; GROWTH; PACIFIC; COLOR; LIGHT; MARINE PRIMARY PRODUCTION; nonlinear response; ocean chlorophyll; PLANKTON","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To understand how changes in behaviour can be predicted by different forms of HIREC, we conducted a meta-analysis of the existing empirical literature focusing on behavioural responses to five axes of environmental change (climate change, changes in CO2, direct human impact, changes in nutrients and biotic exchanges) in five behavioural domains (aggression, exploration, activity, boldness and sociability) across a range of taxa but with a focus on fish and bird species. Our meta-analysis revealed a general absence of directional behavioural responses to HIREC. However, the absolute magnitude of the effect sizes was large. This means that animals have strong behavioural responses to HIREC, but the responses are not clearly in any particular direction. Moreover, the absolute magnitude of the effect sizes differed between different behaviours and different forms of HIREC: Exploration responded more strongly than activity, and climate change induced the strongest behavioural responses. Model heterogeneities identified that effect sizes varied primarily because of study design, and the specific sample of individuals used in a study; phylogeny also explains significant variation in our bird model. Based on these results, we make four recommendations to further our understanding: 1) a more balanced representation of laboratory and field studies, 2) consideration of context dependency, 3) standardisation of the methods and definitions used to quantify and study behaviours and 4) consideration of the role for individual differences in behaviour.","2022-04","2023-09-26 16:12:52","2023-09-26 16:12:52","","","","4","2022","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000695810700001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;10<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;10<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;66</p>","","","climate change; CLIMATE-CHANGE; TERRESTRIAL; URBAN; LIFE; TEMPERATURES; ECOLOGY; PLASTICITY; Bayesian; behaviour; field; FIELD EXPERIMENTS; HETEROGENEITY; laboratory; PERSONALITY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Impacts of climate change include melting glaciers, rising sea levels, species decline and extinctions, as well as, at the individual level and social planes-increasing conflicts, violent behaviour and migration among other issues. Unfortunately, climate change is yet to figure prominently in judicial decisions. India's environmental jurisprudence is still structured around principles such as 'polluter pays', 'sustainable development' and the 'public trust doctrine' which double up as 'fictions' and 'myths' and have limited applicability so far as climate change-related issues are concerned. Analysis of judicial decisions where there is discussion on climate change shows that there is lack of appreciation about the seriousness, enormity and the urgency to deal with the climate crisis by both members of the judiciary as well as lawyers. The failure to address climate change-related issues in a comprehensive manner represents a serious shortcoming in India's judiciary which needs urgent attention.","2021-10","2023-09-26 16:12:52","2023-09-26 16:12:52","","438-458","","3","55","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000764210800007","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;14</p>","","","climate change; TEMPERATURE; litigation; AGGRESSION; courts; judiciary; tribunals","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, how moral convictions influence learning about climate change - another science topic perceived as controversial - has not been studied in depth. The goal of our research was to investigate the predictive relationship between moral convictions, engagement, plausibility, emotions, and knowledge when learning about climate change. Method: Undergraduate pre-service teacher students (N = 348) rated their moral convictions about climate change and read a refutation text on the topic. Results:The majority of students indicated that acting to mitigate climate change was a moral imperative (n = 268) compared with those without a position (n = 80). Results indicate that whether an individual perceives acting on climate change as morally imperative is a powerful precursor to their learning experience. Moreover, those who developed a stronger moral conviction indicated deeper learning, engagement, and stronger negative emotions. Finally, stronger moral convictions, emotions, knowledge, and engagement all predicted seeing the scientific model of climate change as more plausible. Conclusion: Taken together, our results have implications for how moral convictions may influence how educators should engage students and the general public about the topic of climate change.","2022-01-02","2023-09-26 16:12:52","2023-09-26 16:12:52","","58-69","","1","39","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000729361500001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;57</p>","","","Climate change; KNOWLEDGE; ENGAGEMENT; emotions; EARTH; SCIENCE-EDUCATION; ACHIEVEMENT; CONCEPTUAL CHANGE; EMOTIONS; engagement; learning; plausibility; PLAUSIBILITY; REFUTATION TEXT; STUDENTS EVALUATIONS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Knowing and quantifying the processes involved in this dynamic is of fundamental importance for efficient coastal management. This paper investigates the shoreline change that occurred in the shorelines of the Eastern Coast of Rio Grande do Norte state in the last three decades (between 1988 and 2018) and discusses the coastal processes involved, by quantifying average and maximum erosion and accretion rates on the shoreline, based on digital processing of Remote Sensing multispectral images and Geographic Information System. The comparative assessment of shoreline changes considered the errors and uncertainties inherent to spatial resolution of remote sensing images, georeferencing techniques and extraction procedures of each shoreline in statistical analyses using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System modules. The results illustrate an erosive final average balance for about 45% of the shorelines in the last three decades. The average variation rates of the shorelines point out retreat of about -1,20 m/year and accretion of 1.71 m/year.

As the second-largest economy and the largest Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emitter in the world, China's actions on climate change are critical to the global response. Indeed, international cooperation on climate change is unlikely to succeed without China's active engagement. Therefore, China's perception of the fairness of responsibility allocation will significantly influence its attitudes toward its international climate responsibilities. However, limited work has been done to date to concretely examine China's perspective of the fairness of responsibility allocation and to understand its fairness discourses and practices of climate responsibility in a dynamically evolved process. This article aims to fill that gap in the literature by elucidating how China perceives the fair allocation of climate responsibility and how its fairness discourses and practices have evolved over the course of the three phases of international climate change negotiations. It will be shown that China has perceived the factors of historically accumulated emissions, per capita emissions and capability to lie at the very core of its understanding of fairness.","2021-07","2023-09-26 16:12:38","2023-09-26 16:12:38","","63-95","","1","5","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000720124000004","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;130</p>","","","climate change; FRAMEWORK; China; POLITICS; GHG emissions; fairness; CBD; global identity; international climate change law; responsibility","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Experiencing climatic catastrophes via simulation tools has been found to affect the perception of people regarding climate change and promote pro-environmental behaviors. However, not much is known about how experiential feedback and the probability of climate change in a simulation influence the decisions of people. We developed a web-based tool called Interactive Climate Change Simulator (ICCS) to study the impact of different probabilities of climate change and the availability of feedback on the monetary actions (adaptation or mitigation) taken by individuals. A total of 160 participants from India voluntarily played ICCS across four between-subject conditions (N = 40 in each condition). The conditions differed based on the probability of climate change (low or high) and availability of feedback (absent or present). Participants made mitigation and adaptation decisions in ICCS over multiple years and faced monetary consequences of their decisions. There was a significant increase in mitigation actions against climate change when the feedback was present compared to when it was absent. The mitigation and adaptation investments against climate change were not significantly affected by the probability of climate change. The interaction between probability of climate consequences and availability of feedback was significant: In the presence of feedback, the high probability of climate change resulted in higher mitigation and adaptation investments against climate change. Overall, the experience gained in the ICCS tool helped alleviate peoples' ""wait-and-see "" preferences and increased the monetary investments to counter climate change. Simulation tools like ICCS have the potential to increase people's understanding of climatic disasters and can act as a useful aid for educationalists and policymakers.","2021-07-14","2023-09-26 16:12:38","2023-09-26 16:12:38","","","","","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000679044900001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;41</p>","","","ADAPTATION; RISK; TOOL; MITIGATION; ECONOMICS; PERCEPTIONS; MENTAL MODELS; climate microworld; decision aid; feedback-availability; interactive climate change simulator; investment against climate change; wait-and-see preferences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With climate communication, it can be tempting to think that the primary goal should be to get more people to accept climate change, but true climate literacy requires not just an understanding of the reality of climate change but also acting on that understanding. Here, I argue that there is an important role for communicating about climate change with people who already accept that it is occurring. Such communication can help people improve their understanding, increasing their certainty regarding climate change and its drivers, and spur them to take action. Social science research has important insights regarding how to communicate in a way that encourages people to change behaviors, including aiming to increase personal and collective efficacy and helping people figure out how to meet key needs while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Climate change communicators should seek out audiences that already accept climate change, helping those individuals deepen their understanding and energizing and empowering these people to act.","2021-09","2023-09-26 16:12:37","2023-09-26 16:12:37","","433-436","","3","198","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000661978400001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;30</p>","","","climate change; climate action; science communication; EMOTIONS; pedagogy; student understandings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article introduces the concept of 'theories of change' - the methodology by which organisations or movements hope to bring about social change - and applies it to the current climate change and health movement in England. Through movement mapping, the article describes and offers reflections on the climate change and health ecosystems in England. Methods: Organisations working on climate change and health in England were identified and publicly available information was collated to map movement characteristics, target stakeholders and methodologies deployed, using an inductive, iterative approach. Results: A total of 98 organisations working on health and climate change (and/or sustainability) were initially identified, of which 70 met the inclusion criteria. Most organisations target two or more stakeholders, with healthcare workers, management structures, and government being most commonly cited. Methodological approaches identified include Formal education programmes; Awareness-raising; Purchasing-procurement power; Advocacy; Financial; Media-messaging; Networking; Knowledge generation; and Policy making, of which education, awareness-raising, and advocacy are most commonly used. Conclusion: There is a tendency for climate change and health organisations in England to focus on individual level and sectoral change over system change. More could be made of the potential for the healthcare professions' voice and messaging for the wider climate movement. Given the rapid boom of climate change and health organisations in recent years, a mind-set shift that recognises different players as part of a cohesive ecosystem with better coordination and collaboration may reduce unnecessary work, and facilitate more cohesive outcomes.","2021-11","2023-09-26 16:12:37","2023-09-26 16:12:37","","328-337","","6","141","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000724986800011","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;27</p>","","","climate change; health; sustainability; policy change; social movements; theory of change","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using panel quantile regression analysis, the paper empirically tests the effect of adaptation readiness on climate change vulnerability in 51 African countries over the period 1995 to 2018. The findings show that adaptation readiness has a significant negative effect on vulnerability to climate change in the region. The results also demonstrate that Central Africa is the most vulnerable sub-region to climate change with high exposure, high sensitivity, and low adaptive capacity. Whereas Southern and North Africa are the least vulnerable sub-regions to climate change in Africa. The differences in climate change vulnerability and adaptation readiness across Africa imply that blanket allocation of climate adaptation support and resources is unlikely to be effective.

The study revealed that most farmers perceived climate changes. 88.3% of the respondents noted a decrease in rainfall, 79.1% reported poor rainfall distribution, 88.3% perceived a late onset of rainfall while 76.6% perceived an increase in temperature. The farmers' perception mirrored the actual climatic data trends for the area obtained from the meteorological department. The major climate-smart agriculture practices adopted by farmers in the area included; diversification of crops, change of planting time and crop rotation/mixed cropping. The adoption of climate-smart agriculture practices significantly correlated with the household size, monthly income, access to credit and farmers' perception of climate change.

We investigated these demographic effects by experimentally manipulating climate and measuring responses of lambda in nine populations spanning the elevation range of an alpine plant (Ivesia lycopodioides). Populations exhibited stable growth rates (lambda < 1) under naturally wet conditions and declining rates (lambda < 1) under naturally dry conditions. However, opposing vital rate responses to experimental heating and watering lead to negligible or negative effects on population stability.

The impact of climate change and its variation on the productivity of cereals in smallholder settings under future production systems in Navrongo, Ghana and Nioro du Rip, Senegal was assessed in this study. Data on management practices obtained from household surveys and projected agricultural development pathways (through stakeholder engagements), soil data, weather data (historical: 1980-2009 and five General Circulation Models; mid-century time slice 2040-2069 for two Representative Concentration Pathways; 4.5 and 8.5) were used for the impact assessment, employing a crop simulation model. Ensemble maize yield changes under the sustainable agricultural development pathway (SDP) were -13 and -16%, while under the unsustainable development pathway (USDP), yield changes were -19 and -20% in Navrongo and Nioro du Rip, respectively. The impact on sorghum and millet were lower than that on maize. Variations in climate change impact among smallholders were high with relative standard deviations (RSD) of between 14% and 60% across the cereals with variability being higher under the USDP, except for millet.

This study explored women farmers' perceived indices of occurrence and severity of observed climate extremes in rural Ghana. Employing the qualitative method approach, eight focus group discussions and 15 interviews were conducted with women farmers under Centre for Alleviation of Poverty, Environment and Child Support GROW Project. The study adopted the thematic analytical approach for the data analysis. The results of the study revealed that the occurrence of drought, flood and bush fires has been an annual phenomenon over the past decade. In terms of severity, women farmers also reported that climate extremes, when they occurred, were very intense, especially drought and bush fires. The results further indicated that rainfall and temperature variations were markedly observed with the prediction of rainfall in particular becoming extremely difficult. Evidently, women farmers observed that climate extremes were caused by deforestation, bush fires and neglect of veneration of ancestral spirits. Importantly, the study found that women have devised their own means of responding to climate extremes to include support networks, savings and spiritual assistance from ancestors for rain when there was prolonged drought. The study recommends the need for the Ministry of Food and Agriculture and the Ministry of Environment Science and Technology to forecast and display information on the yearly occurrence and severity of drought, flood and bush fires to complement women's local knowledge in decision making.","2022-01","2023-09-26 16:12:37","2023-09-26 16:12:37","","810-831","","1","24","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000646568500002","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;8<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;8<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;74</p>","","","VARIABILITY; Climate change; Climate extremes; Ghana; INDIGENOUS KNOWLEDGE; Rural Savannah; Women farmers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most current measures to manage the impacts of hazards on CRs use vulnerability assessments, but because these require that all CRs be treated as having an equal chance of being affected by climate-change hazards (i. e., equal exposure) across large landscapes, the cost and resources required for such analyses are overwhelming to land management agencies. Projections of changes in many hazards, however, show that the probability of hazard occurrence will be unevenly distributed on the landscape. Incorporating this information into a risk assessment thus allows CR managers to prioritize their efforts on assessing impacts to CRs in those areas where the probability of the hazard is greatest, thus increasing efficiency. We provide several heuristic examples of implementing the first part of a CR risk assessment by using 21st-century projections of several hazards most likely to adversely affect CRs on nine National Forests (NFs) managed by the U.S. Forest Service in northern Idaho and Montana. Overlaying the projected distribution of hazards on these NFs with the distribution of CRs identifies CR exposure that, with information on their vulnerability, is required to determine risk. Additional policy and field studies will be needed to determine how to prioritize those CRs that are most at risk according to their significance as well as identify how impacts can be reduced and managed through adaptation planning and implementation. Adaptation will follow the iterative risk management process particularly by improving projection resolution. Finer scale, process-based modeling informed by the highest priority CRs would also provide a means to assess various adaptation options that might change the estimated risk and increase the odds of CRs being as little affected as possible.","2022","2023-09-26 16:12:37","2023-09-26 16:12:37","","","","","35","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000776078700010","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;61</p>","","","Climate change; WILDFIRE; Risk assessment; Climate extremes; Cultural resources; Management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Testing the climate change hope vs. fear communications debate through online videos","CLIMATIC CHANGE","","0165-0009","10.1007/s10584-021-02975-8","","A growing body of research has explored whether evoking hope or fear about climate change is more effective at catalyzing attitude and behavior change among the public. Prior studies on this topic have primarily tested responses to text and/or still image manipulations, finding mixed results. Amid the rapidly growing creation and consumption of climate change video content online, it is important that researchers also consider how the public may engage with hope and fear narratives presented in videos. This study aims to help fill this gap by examining how Americans respond to hope and doom and gloom climate change frames portrayed in short online videos. Participants who watched the hope and doom videos reported experiencing the respective emotions the videos sought to elicit (hope and fear). Participants with different political affiliations and with contrasting climate change attitudes across the Six Americas of Global Warming reported significantly different levels of fear, but only participants across the Six Americas reported significantly different levels of hope. However, despite these emotional responses, neither video was associated with significant differences in climate change risk perceptions, likelihood of behavior change, or likelihood of climate activism. These null results suggest that the impacts of a single hope or fear appeal can be overstated and caution against claims that either hopeful or fear-driven climate change communication strategies are necessarily optimal. Open-ended survey responses to the videos also suggest that ideological views about climate change may be associated with how individuals respond to specific video production elements, including music, editing, pacing, and visuals.","2021-01","2023-09-26 16:12:37","2023-09-26 16:12:37","","","","1-2","164","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000611533900001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;24<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;25<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;70</p>","","","SCIENCE; ENGAGEMENT; Climate change communication; Framing; SUPPORT; EMOTION; METAANALYSIS; EFFICACY; APPEALS; Climate activism; Fear; Hope; MECHANICAL TURK; VALIDITY; Video; WARNINGS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With IPCC's 6th Assessment Report scheduled to be released in 2021-22, we asked: how has climate change and health research in North America advanced since the IPCC's 5th Assessment Report in 2014? Specifically, we systematically identified and examined trends in the extent, range, and nature of climate-health research conducted in North America. We used a scoping review methodology to systematically identify literature and map publication trends. A search string was used to search five academic databases. Two independent reviewers first screened titles and abstracts, and then the full texts of articles for relevance. Research articles and reviews using systematic methods published since 2013 were eligible for inclusion, and no language restrictions were applied. To be included, articles had to measure and link climatic variables or hazards to health outcomes in North America. Relevant articles were analysed using descriptive statistics to explore publication trends. The number of climate-health articles has significantly increased since the last IPCC Assessment Report. Published research about climate change impacts, heat-related mortality and morbidity, and respiratory illness taking place in urban centres and in the USA continue to dominate the North American climate-health literature, reflected by the high proportion of articles published. Important research gaps on previously neglected climate-sensitive health outcomes, however, are beginning to be filled, including climate change impacts on mental health, nutrition, and foodborne disease. We also observed progress in research that included future projections of climate-health risks; however, projection research is still relatively nascent and under-studied for many climate-sensitive health outcomes in North America, and would benefit from considering social and demographic variables in models. Important research disparities in geographical coverage were noted, including research gaps in Canada and Mexico, and in rural and remote regions. Overall, these publication trends suggest an improved understanding of exposure-response relationships and future projections of climate-health risks for many climate-sensitive health outcomes in North America, which is promising and provides an evidence-base to inform the IPCC 6th Assessment Report. Despite these advancements and considering the urgent policy and practice implications, more research is needed to deepen our understanding of climate-sensitive health outcomes, as well as examine new arising issues that have limited evidence-bases. In particular, transdisciplinary and cross-sector research, that includes the social sciences, examining current and future climate-health adaptation, mitigation, and the adaptation-mitigation nexus should become a top priority for research, given the urgent need for this evidence to inform climate change policies, actions, and interventions.","2021-08","2023-09-26 16:12:37","2023-09-26 16:12:37","","","","","199","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000663721300008","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;52</p>","","","ADAPTATION; Climate change; North America; Health; CO-BENEFITS; RISKS; (IPCC); Intergovernmental panel on climate change; Scoping review","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Evidence suggests that reactions to climate science and proposed solutions are strongly driven by emotion. This paper explores whether negative emotional responses to learning about climate impacts support recognition of the reality and risks of climate change, and whether narrative-based climate communication is an effective means of eliciting such emotions. In an experiment among U.S. residents, participants read narratives about climate change-related warming at the North Pole designed to elicit an emotional response. They reported on their emotional reactions; climate change attitudes, intentions, and behaviors; and demographics. We found that experiencing negative emotion increased acceptance of, concern about, and willingness to take action on climate change. Strong negative emotional response was particularly influential in changing climate attitudes for conservatives. A similar pattern of results was, surprisingly, observed for positive emotional response. Climate narratives were successful in eliciting negative and positive emotional responses, across both factual and emotion-laden narratives. These findings suggest that enhancing emotion through climate communication may be a promising tool for counteracting biased assimilation of controversial scientific information, and for engaging audiences who might otherwise dismiss or avoid the issue of climate change for group-identity or ideological reasons.","2021-07-04","2023-09-26 16:12:37","2023-09-26 16:12:37","","571-593","","5","15","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000613813700001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;19<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;19<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;74</p>","","","climate change; climate action; Narratives; negative and positive emotion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we focus on the elevational distribution of forest fires in mountainous ecoregions of the western United States and show the largest increase rates in burned area above 2,500 m during 1984 to 2017. Furthermore, we show that high-elevation fires advanced upslope with a median cumulative change of 252 m (-107 to 656 m; 95% CI) in 34 y across studied ecoregions. We also document a strong interannual relationship between high-elevation fires and warm season vapor pressure deficit (VPD). The upslope advance of fires is consistent with observed warming reflected by a median upslope drift of VPD isolines of 295 m (59 to 704 m; 95% CI) during 1984 to 2017. These findings allow us to estimate that recent climate trends reduced the high-elevation flammability barrier and enabled fires in an additional 11% of western forests. Limited influences of fire management practices and longer fire-return intervals in these montane mesic systems suggest these changes are largely a byproduct of climate warming. Further weakening in the high-elevation flammability barrier with continued warming has the potential to transform montane fire regimes with numerous implications for ecosystems and watersheds.","2021-06-01","2023-09-26 16:12:36","2023-09-26 16:12:36","","","","22","118","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000659461900003","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;60<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;60<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;52</p>","","","climate change; SNOW; wildfire; WILDFIRE; REGIMES; INCREASE; UNITED-STATES; climate velocity; CALIFORNIA; ANTHROPOGENIC CLIMATE-CHANGE; CHANGE VELOCITY; ELEVATION; fire elevation; montane forests","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In East Africa tremendous rains triggered flooding and landslides in Kenya, causing over 100 deaths and the displacement of some 18,000 people. The situation was exacerbated by an unprecedented locust plague made possible by the intense rains. Floods in the Democratic Republic of the Congo displaced some 40,000 people. The level of the Mono River jumped a meter in four days, producing floods that affected some 50,000 residents of Benin and Togo. This article places the October and November 2019 rainfall extremes in historic context and analyzes the juxtaposition of forcings required to explain these unprecedented hydro-climatic extremes in equatorial Africa. The meteorological factors considered include the Dipole Mode Index, zonal winds over the central Indian Ocean, the Walker circulation, moisture flux and divergence, ENSO and tropical sea-surface temperatures in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, and zonal circulation. The Dipole Mode Index reached record levels and anomalously high values persisted for five months. This was clearly a major factor in eastern Africa. The impact there was enhanced by increased moisture flux from the Indian Ocean and a marked reduction of the descending branch of the Indian Ocean Walker cell, which strongly controls October-November rainfall. The factors in other regions included extremely warm SSTs in the tropical eastern Atlantic Ocean, the Walker circulation, anomalous moisture flux and flux divergence, and changes in the zonal winds.","2022-01","2023-09-26 16:12:36","2023-09-26 16:12:36","","","","","208","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000718563100001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;10<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;10<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;77</p>","","","CLIMATE; WAVES; TELECONNECTIONS; RAINFALL VARIABILITY; Climate extremes; CIRCULATION MECHANISMS; CONGO BASIN; EAST-AFRICA; Eastern Africa; Equatorial Africa; Global climate change; GREATER HORN; INDIAN-OCEAN DIPOLE; SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURES","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although climate scientists would like to be as precise as possible, policymakers with different attitudes towards climate change will always choose the result that matches their own value judgments. This paper discusses the impact of climate change attitudes on optimal mitigation in 15 regions. The climate change attitude is refined by a meta-analysis of 27 climate damage estimations and distilled into five damage functions. The optimal mitigation is calculated using the non-cooperative scenario of the regional integrated model of climate economy (RICE). The results show that the optimal mitigation paths in developing countries are more sensitive to climate change attitudes than they are in developed countries. In 2100, the range of optimal emissions represents 20% of the average optimal emissions by developing countries, which is twice the value of average optimal emissions by developed countries. The average social carbon cost in developing countries is 20 times higher than that in developed countries. This large uncertainty may be the combined result of high shadow prices of capital and large quantities of future emissions in these developing countries.","2021-09-01","2023-09-26 16:12:36","2023-09-26 16:12:36","","","","","313","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000683880500009","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;59</p>","","","TEMPERATURE; Climate change; PROJECTIONS; POLICY; GROWTH; INTEGRATED ASSESSMENT; CARBON; SOCIAL COST; TIPPING POINTS; Climate damage; DAMAGE COSTS; IAMs; Impact assessment; LEADERS; Political attitudes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Global climate model (GCMs) are rarely used to study watershed-scale hydrology due to the relatively coarse grid resolution, computationally expensive downscaling, and simplified physical processes. Recently, however, watershed-scale hydrology analysis has become possible in GCMs due to the development of variable-resolution GCMs that dynamically couple the hydrological processes between atmospheric and land systems at fine resolutions in selected regions and coarse resolution elsewhere. In this study, we used the variable-resolution Community Earth System Model (VR-CESM) with refined-resolution (14 km) in the western U.S. and eastern China to evaluate smaller watershed-scale hydrology. We compared the historical VR-CESM outputs with gauge measurements and other hydrological models (e.g., National Water Model in the U.S.) and calibrated the subsurface runoff capacities in four mountainous watersheds. An RCP8.5 projection from 2007 to 2050 is used to estimate the impact of changing precipitation and snow climatology on watershed hydrology. We also analyzed the long-term runoff variability and the possibility of extreme runoff events as simulated by the VR-CESM. Although calibration is not possible in larger-scale watersheds, VR-CESM simulates the long-term annual variability of watersheds and provides insights on climate change impacts on hydrology. We conclude that refined-resolution VR-CESM can be used for watershed-scale hydrology analysis to understand water resources and water balance, in addition to traditional watershed-scale hydrological models. It enables hydrological analysis at multiple watersheds in one simulation and can help understand the two-way dynamics between land surface hydrology and atmospheric processes, and is especially practical for projecting climate change impacts. However, it is challenging to apply VR-CESM for hydrologic analysis in regulated watersheds as human factors (e.g., pumping, irrigation, water diversion) have not been fully addressed in VR-CESM.","2021-10","2023-09-26 16:12:36","2023-09-26 16:12:36","","","","","601","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000695816300062","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;7<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;7<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;52</p>","","","TEMPERATURE; Climate change; PRECIPITATION; IMPACTS; SWAT; CALIBRATION; Global climate model; ENSEMBLE; Watersheds; CALIFORNIA; STATES; Runoff; Water budget","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we assess 21st-century changes in hydroclimate over Hispaniola Island using precipitation, temperature, and surface soil moisture data from the 6th Phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). The resulting analysis indicates, as with the previous 5th Phase of CMIP (CMIP5) models, that Hispaniola Island might see a significant drying through the 21st century. The aridity appears to be robust in most of the island following the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) 5-8.6, which assumes the ""worst case"" greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. We find a significant reduction in both annual mean precipitation and surface soil moisture (soil's upper 10 cm), although it appears to be more pronounced for precipitation (up to 26% and 11% for precipitation and surface soil moisture, respectively). Even though we provide insights into future hydroclimate changes on Hispaniola Island, CMIP6's intrinsic uncertainties and native horizontal resolution precludes us to better assess these changes at local scales. As such, we consider future dynamical downscaling efforts that might help us to better inform policy-makers and stakeholders in terms of drought risk.","2021-01","2023-09-26 16:12:36","2023-09-26 16:12:36","","","","1","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000609759400001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;52</p>","","","climate change; CMIP6; PRECIPITATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; climate models; HIGH-RESOLUTION; drought; Caribbean; Hispaniola Island; MEXICO; MIDSUMMER DROUGHT","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Research into this area has been rapidly expanding, but knowledge gaps still exist. We conducted a review of the literature to provide a synthesis of extreme climate events on insects and identify future areas of research. In our review, we asked the following questions: 1) What are the direct and indirect mechanisms that extreme climate events affect individual insects? 2) What are the effects of extreme climate events on insect populations and demography? 3) What are the implications of the extreme climate events effects on insect communities? Drought was among the most frequently described type of extreme climate event affecting insects, as well as the effects of temperature extremes and extreme temperature variation. Our review explores the factors that determine the sensitivity or resilience to climate extremes for individuals, populations, and communities. We also identify areas of future research to better understand the role of extreme climate events on insects including effects on non-trophic interactions, alteration of population dynamics, and mediation of the functional the trait set of communities. Many insect species are under threat from global change and extreme climate events are a contributing factor. Biologists and policy makers should consider the role of extreme events in their work to mitigate the loss of biodiversity and delivery of ecosystem services by insects. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Its population response to climate change is of high interest to managers because climate-induced declines may adversely affect critical ecosystem services that this species provides. While previous studies of reproductive size classes of the species have projected dramatic reductions in area of suitable habitat under climate warming scenarios, it has been suggested that the species can tolerate warmer and drier conditions if seedlings and saplings are not competitively excluded by other conifer species. Thus, we asked if juvenile-sized PIAL are found in warmer and drier locations than larger individuals, under the assumption that competitive exclusion would require several years to decades to influence the distribution of regenerating PIAL. We used a new genetic technique to distinguish non-cone bearing PIAL from the more warmdry tolerant limber pine (P. flexilis) among samples collected along transects extending from lower treeline to the subalpine around the GYE. Predictor data on climate and water balance were obtained from a 250-m spatially explicit data product. We used a stochastic gradient boosting model to predict probability of presence of PIAL 1 cm dbh (diameter at breast height) and =1 cm dbh as a function of these predictors. We discovered that smaller diameter PIAL were not proportionally more abundant at lower elevations, suggesting that competitive exclusion may not be the primary mechanism limiting this species' low elevation distribution. In contrast, the small size class PIAL were slightly less warm-dry tolerant than larger individuals. This suggests that the zone of regeneration of PIAL has shifted upwards in elevation in recent decades, perhaps associated with the observed warming in the GYE. In comparison to a previous study of reproductive-sized trees (>20 cm dbh) from a coarser (1.6 km) sampling frame, however, the predicted zone of suitable habitat of PIAL (<1 cm dbh) was 122 m lower in elevation. We conclude that consideration of the fine-scale distribution of PIAL near lower treeline suggests that the tree species is slightly less sensitive to climate warming than found by previous studies of reproductivesized trees, but, nonetheless, large range contractions of PIAL in GYE are likely under projected future climates.","2021-08-01","2023-09-26 16:12:36","2023-09-26 16:12:36","","","","","493","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000651205800006","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;53</p>","","","Climate change; CALIFORNIA; TREE; RECRUITMENT; ALBICAULIS; Climate tolerances; Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem; GREATER YELLOWSTONE ECOSYSTEM; SUB-ALPINE FORESTS; WATER-DEFICIT; Whitebark pine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since the 1980s, there has been an increase in mass coral bleaching and associated coral mortality due to more frequent and severe thermal stress. Although most research has focused on the role of temperature, coral bleaching is a product of the interacting effects of temperature and other environmental variables such as solar radiation. High light exacerbates the effects of thermal stress on corals, whereas reductions in light can reduce sensitivity to thermal stress. Here, we use an updated global dataset of coral bleaching observations (n = 35,769) from 1985 to 2017 and satellite-derived datasets of SST and clouds to examine for the first time at a global scale the influence of cloudiness on the likelihood of bleaching from thermal stress. We find that among coral reefs exposed to severe bleaching-level heat stress (Degree Heating Weeks >8 degrees C.week), bleaching severity is inversely correlated with the interaction of heat stress and cloud fraction anomalies (p < 0.05), such that higher cloudiness implies reduced bleaching response. A Random Forest model analysis employing different set of environmental variables shows that a model employing Degree Heating Weeks and the 30-day cloud fraction anomaly most accurately predicts bleaching severity (Accuracy = 0.834; Cohen's Kappa = 0.769). Based on these results and global warm-season cloudiness patterns, we develop a 'cloudy refugia' index which identifies the central equatorial Pacific and French Polynesia as regions where cloudiness is most likely to protect corals from bleaching. Our findings suggest that incorporating cloudiness into prediction models can help delineate bleaching responses and identify reefs which may be more resilient to climate change.","2021-08","2023-09-26 16:12:36","2023-09-26 16:12:36","","3474-3486","","15","27","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000653107100001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;13<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;14<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;72</p>","","","climate change; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RISK; OCEAN; CLOUDS; multiple stressors; SOLAR-RADIATION; ALGAL SYMBIONTS; climate change refugia; cloud cover; coral bleaching; sea surface temperature","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Adequate summer precipitation, particularly in the reproductive and grain fill stages in July and August, is critical to corn and soybean success. Meanwhile, excessive spring precipitation can cause significant planting delays and introduces challenges with weed and pest management, and soil erosion and compaction. However, uncertainty especially in future summer precipitation changes, translates to uncertainties in how the joint distributions of spring and summer precipitation are expected to change by mid- and late-century across the Midwest. This study examines historical and projected changes in the characteristics of spring and summer precipitation in the Midwest using 12 dynamically downscaled simulations under the high-emission representative concentration pathway (RCP 8.5) from the NA-CORDEX project. Historical increases in spring precipitation and precipitation intensity are projected to continue into the mid- and late-century across the region, with strong model agreement. By comparison, projected changes in Midwest summer precipitation are more modest than for spring and have much less model agreement. Despite a projected three- to four-fold increase in the frequency of wet springs by late-century, relative to the model ensemble historical average, the lack of substantial and robust projected change in summer precipitation results in only a small increase in the risk of dry summers following wet springs in the Midwest by mid- and late-century.","2021-12-24","2023-09-26 16:12:36","2023-09-26 16:12:36","","","","","3","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001027115500001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;49</p>","","","climate change; agriculture; drought; Midwest; climate projections; NA-CORDEX","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But stakeholder participation remains loosely interpreted and evaluating measures are limited. This study employs social network analysis (SNA) to investigate how social relations among stakeholders, which emerge as a result of participation, are associated with stakeholder learning, as changes in perceptions of climate change. We hypothesized that reciprocal ties of understanding, respect, and influence can predict changes in perceptions of climate change. This approach was applied to a case study in Deal Island Peninsula, Maryland (USA) where local residents, scientists, and government officials met from 2016 to 2018 to collaboratively manage the impacts of sea-level rise in their communities. We found that social relations based on mutual understanding, respect, and influence are positively associated with perceptions of climate change. We provide a detailed conceptualization and implementation of a network-based approach that may serve as a potential quantitative performance measure of stakeholder participation processes in climate change adaptation. Overall, this study provides empirical evidence of the role that emerging social relations have on enhancing or constraining social learning among stakeholders in the Deal Island Peninsula project.","2021-01-15","2023-09-26 16:12:36","2023-09-26 16:12:36","","","","","278","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000599706300006","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;11<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;11<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;84</p>","","","Climate change; RISK; Climate change adaptation; KNOWLEDGE; MANAGEMENT; GOVERNANCE; IMPLEMENTATION; SYSTEMS; AUTOCORRELATION; COMANAGEMENT; CONTAGION; Social contagion; Social learning; Social network analysis; SOCIAL NETWORKS; Stakeholder participation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Universities are key actors in climate change education, and potentially progressive organisations researching, teaching and implementing low carbon futures. Using universities' sustainability strategies, we present a secondary analysis identifying neoliberalism's significant role in influencing universities' sustainability policies and practices. This plays out through university boosterism where universities use their sustainability work to claim sustainability leadership, representing a form of sustainability capital to attract funding and potential students. Furthermore, we suggest a cognitive-practice gap exists between those researching sustainability and those implementing sustainability in universities. Thus, we conclude that there are inherent tensions in universities' sustainability governance, with universities embodying contradictory sustainability discourses and advancing a form of green capitalism. Entrenched neoliberal ideologies present challenges for those declaring a climate emergency and how such declarations are subsequently operationalised.","2021","2023-09-26 16:12:36","2023-09-26 16:12:36","","29-40","","2","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000645235800004","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;7<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;7<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;69</p>","","","climate change; climate emergency; KNOWLEDGE; POLICY; sustainability; CITIES; POLITICS; ENERGY DEMAND; neoliberalism; HIGHER-EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS; United Kingdom; universities","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study examines whether the effect of climate change on economic growth and political stability (measure for productivity growth) depends on the level of climate adaptation readiness, using data from 44 African countries. We conducted several robustness checks to identify the relationship of interest. The result confirms that increases in temperature exert significant negative effect on economic growth and productivity growth, but these effects critically depend on the level of adaptation readiness. For countries with enhanced adaptation capacity, we find that it is possible for them to see a resurgence in their economic growth after a rise in temperature. However, for countries with low capacity to adapt, climate change might produce permanent damages on economic growth and productivity growth. Thus, in Africa, beyond the level of income, the quality of institution is another channel through which climate change could affect economic growth. Integrating climate adaptation into development agenda is critical, but they should be pro-poor in nature.","2021-09-01","2023-09-26 16:12:35","2023-09-26 16:12:35","","","","","293","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000677855200006","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;19<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;19<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;55</p>","","","TEMPERATURE; Climate change; IMPACT; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; POLICY; Economic growth; Africa; AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION; Institutions; Climate adaptation readiness; FDI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Australia, the term gained traction during the 2019-2020 'Black Summer' bushfires. The (un)natural disaster prompted local governments, industries, peak bodies and academic collectives to 'declare' a climate emergency and call for immediate action on climate change. We note, however, that there has been no declaration from geographers in Australia. As a discipline whose members are embedded in research, teaching and advocacy about climate change - and the interlinked crises of biodiversity loss and environmental and social justice - we found this surprising. It is self-evident that climate change matters to geographers. So, is a declaration of a climate emergency from the discipline necessary? In writing this piece we reflect on our experiences of the 2019-2020 summer and conversations with fellow geographers, to consider what a declaration of an emergency does, who it is for and what actions it might mobilise. In conclusion, we call on geographers in Australia to declare an emergency which foregrounds the interlinked crises of climate change, biodiversity loss and social (in)justice. The detail of what this declaration says and means in practice is open for discussion. We ask many questions throughout this paper as a way to invite you - our fellow geographers - to join us in this conversation.","2021-01-02","2023-09-26 16:12:35","2023-09-26 16:12:35","","1-18","","1","52","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000605386200001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;7<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;7<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;62</p>","","","climate change; WORK; biodiversity; BOUNDARIES; bushfire; Climate emergency; emergency declaration; geography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the interest of transparent and honesty, such uncertainty should be communicated to the general public. Thus, it is important to investigate how such uncertainty should be communicated to the general public. This study explored three uncertainty representation formats-average, range, and multi-value-to investigate how each format affected the general public's trust, perceived accuracy, perceived likelihood, and concern after acknowledging the presence of uncertainty in climate projections (i.e., the use of multi-model climate projections). We conducted a web survey of 2400 participants in Japan, in which we randomly assigned each participant to one of three formats by which climate projection uncertainty was presented. We then asked participants to rate trust, perceived accuracy, perceived likelihood, and concern regarding the climate projections. The multi-value format enhanced trust and perceived accuracy and partially increased perceived likelihood and concern regarding the climate projections compared to the average and range formats, regardless of participants' numeracy and education level. This study suggests that the multi-value format might be effective for communicating multi-model projections and promoting public trust and support for climate polices.","2021-06","2023-09-26 16:12:35","2023-09-26 16:12:35","","","","5","26","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000661474100002","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;49</p>","","","Climate change; UNCERTAINTY; RESPONSES; INFORMATION; POLICY; Risk communication; WILLINGNESS; RISK PERCEPTION; Climate projection; Trust; Uncertainty; COMPREHENSION; Concern; DECISIONS; INTELLIGENCE; NUMERACY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In comparison to the rest of the world, South Africa has one of the highest incidences of lightning-related injuries and deaths. The latest available lightning detection techniques and technologies are reviewed and include current research in South Africa and South Africa's lightning detection challenges. Technological advances have contributed towards improving lightning detection and monitoring activities in many countries. South Africa has made considerably more progress in the field of lightning research than other African countries and possesses one of the three ground-based lightning detection networks in the southern hemisphere. However, despite these developments, rural communities in South Africa, and indeed in Africa, remain vulnerable to lightning, the occurrence of which is predicted to increase with climate change. A large proportion of the population of African countries resides in rural areas, where citizens participate in subsistence farming, and built infrastructure is not lightning safe. We recommend a call for the integration of indigenous and scientific knowledge as well as for the development of a participatory early warning system. Investigations into determining the most effective way to utilise existing monitoring networks - but with warning dissemination to rural communities - are also required. Lastly, future research on the development of lightning-safe rural dwellings or shelters, especially in lightning prone areas, is needed. Significance: Climate change projections of increases in lightning incidence highlight an increased risk for vulnerable communities. There is a lack of literature focusing on lightning detection within rural communities. Technological advances now allow for better dissemination of lightning information and early warning within rural communities. The South African Lightning Detection Network is operational at a national level; however, there is no dissemination at a local level. There are currently no recommended design guidelines for informal dwellings and no safety protocols for rural communities.","2021-01","2023-09-26 16:12:35","2023-09-26 16:12:35","","","","1-2","117","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000662660800009","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;54</p>","","","climate change; CLIMATE-CHANGE; extreme weather; climate; IMAGING SENSOR; lightning activity; rural communities; THUNDERSTORMS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The simulations are conducted at a 25 km horizontal grid spacing and are driven by three CMIP5 general circulation models (GCMs) under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5). The RegCM4 captures most features of the observed TC climatology, except for the TC intensity, which is thus statistically adjusted using a bias correction procedure to account for the effect of the coarse model resolution. The RegCM4 exhibits an improved simulation of several TC statistics compared to the driving GCMs, over most basins analyzed. In future climate conditions we find significant increases in TC frequency over the North Indian Ocean, the Northwest Pacific and Eastern Pacific regions, which are consistent with an increase in mid-tropospheric relative humidity. The North Atlantic and Australasia regions show a decrease in TC frequency, mostly associated with an increase in wind shear. We also find a consistent increase in future storm rainfall rates associated with TCs and in the frequency of the most intense TCs over most domains. Our study shows robust responses often, but not always, in line with previous studies, still implying the presence of significant uncertainties in the projection of TC characteristics, which need to be addressed using large ensembles of simulations with high-resolution models.","2021-09","2023-09-26 16:12:35","2023-09-26 16:12:35","","1507-1531","","5-6","57","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000637478400001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;10<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;10<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;98</p>","","","Climate change; Tropical cyclones; Regional climate model; CORDEX-CORE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this context, the Grande River Basin (GRB) stands out in Brazil. Some studies have been carried out to investigate the impacts of climate change in tropical regions to support water resources' management and planning. This study aims to project the changes in the runoff that feed the Furnas Hydropower Plant (FHP) reservoir (GRB-Furnas basin), the largest and most important facility in Southeast Brazil. The lavras simulation of hydrology model (LASH) was used to project the impacts on runoff and hydrological droughts over the century in GRB-Furnas. The regional climate models (RCMs) Eta-HadGEM-ES, Eta-MIROC5, and Eta-CanESM2 forced the LASH model from 2007 to 2099, taking the representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5. LASH simulated the runoff adequately for the baseline period (1961-2005) using the RCMs' outputs. A noticeable reduction in precipitation was identified in the wet season, especially in the 2007-2040 period for RCP4.5 and in the 2071-2099 period for RCP8.5. As a result, a significant reduction in the runoff, mainly in the baseflow, and an increase in droughts' severity were projected throughout the XXI Century, which may compromise the water security to the FHP reservoir.","2021-06","2023-09-26 16:12:35","2023-09-26 16:12:35","","","","11","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000660843700001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;13<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;14<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;53</p>","","","climate change; UNCERTAINTY; STREAMFLOW; SIMULATION; PERFORMANCE; BIAS CORRECTION; regional climate models; hydrological impacts; GRANDE RIVER-BASIN; HYDROLOGICAL MODEL; hydrological simulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is shown that the changes in T can either lag behind the changes in q or lead them, depending on the type of external forcing, its time scale, the amplitude, and the direction of the change in the state of the system. In particular, when the amplitudes of T and q are sufficiently large, the response of one variable to changes in the other is markedly different from the linear one: the dependence of T on changes in q is logarithmic, and the dependence of q on changes in T is close to exponential.

Understanding the hydroclimatic dynamic regime and, consequently, related climate changes is essential for decision-makers of the hydroelectrical sector. In this context, the Xingo hydropower plant and its drainage area are taken as a reference for the hydroclimatic features analyzed in this research. Observed rainfall in the drainage basin and streamflow measurements in the power plant between 1975 and 2016 are used to assess the climatology of the region and to identify trends in the time series. In addition, a methodological framework based on numerical modeling of the hydroclimatic variables is employed to examine the representation of the present climate (1961 to 1990) and to investigate the future projections (2011 to 2100). The outputs from the Eta regional climate model runs driven by two global models are adopted in this case under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 IPCC scenarios along with the SMAP rainfall-runoff model. In Xingo, the average annual precipitation is about 978 mm and the average annual streamflow is 2,534 m(3) s(-1). The size of the Xingo HPP drainage area must be considered, as the rainfall that occurs in a given month can influence the streamflow of the following month. There is no trend regarding precipitation, while the streamflow time series show a statistically significant decreasing trend in the present climate. Climate projections point to an elevation in air temperature and a reduction in rainfall and streamflow by 2100. Most scenarios indicate that the average annual streamflow could be extremely low for nearly half of the twenty-first century. The results shown in this work may contribute to scenarios for operation of the Xingo HPP and support with information for planning decisions on country's energy security in the present and future climates.","2022-02","2023-09-26 16:12:35","2023-09-26 16:12:35","","13-28","","1","27","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000725911500001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;83</p>","","","RAINFALL; TEMPERATURE; TRENDS; Climate change; PRECIPITATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BIAS CORRECTION; Precipitation; SUMMER MONSOON; Hydropower; Streamflow; AMAZON; Climate model; SOUTH-AMERICA; FRANCISCO; Sao Francisco","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We show that globally, humid heat may currently be associated with over 650 billion hours of annual lost labor (148 million full time equivalent jobs lost), 400 billion hours more than previous estimates. These differences in labor loss estimates are comparable to losses caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Globally, annual heat-induced labor productivity losses are estimated at 2.1 trillion in 2017 PPP$, and in several countries are equivalent to more than 10% of gross domestic product.

In this study we draw on the latest set of UK climate projections, UKCP, to examine metrics relating to high-impact weather over the UK and how these change with different levels of future global warming from 1.5 degrees C to 4 degrees C above pre-industrial. The changes to these hazards show increases in the frequency of extremely hot days and nights, with a UK average increase in hot days of between 5 and 39 days per year between 1.5 degrees C and 4 degrees C of global warming. Projections indicate an increase in cooling degree days of 134-627% and an increase in growing degree days of 19-60% between 1.5 degrees C and 4 degrees C of global warming. Extremely hot nights, which are currently rare, are emerging as more common occurrences. The frequency of high daily temperatures and rainfall increase systematically, while the frequency of very cold conditions (based on days where temperatures fall below 0 degrees C) is shown to decrease by 10 to 49 days per year. A reduction in heating degree days, of 11-32% between 1.5 degrees C and 4 degrees C of warming, is projected. Levels of daily rainfall, which currently relate to increased risk of river flooding, are shown to increase across the country, with increases of days with high impact levels of rainfall occurring by 1 to 8 days per year between 1.5 degrees C and 4 degrees C of warming. Average drought severity is projected to increase for 3-, 6-, 12- and 36-month-long droughts.

These projections, however, typically rely on relatively coarse similar to 100 km resolution models that can misrepresent important processes driving precipitation, such as extratropical cyclone activity, and ocean eddies. Here, we show that a pioneering 50 km atmosphere-1/12 degrees ocean global coupled model projects a substantially larger increase in winter precipitation over northwestern Europe by mid-century than lower-resolution configurations. For this increase, both the highest ocean and atmosphere model resolutions are essential: only the eddy-rich (1/12 degrees) ocean projects a progressive northward shift of the Gulf Stream. This leads to a strong regional ocean surface warming that intensifies air-sea heat fluxes and baroclinicity. For this then to translate into a strengthening of North Atlantic extratropical cyclone activity, the 50 km atmosphere is essential, as it enables enhanced diabatic heating from water vapor condensation and an acceleration of the upper-level mean flow, which weaken vertical stability. Our results suggest that all recent IPCC climate projections using traditional similar to 100 km resolution models could be underestimating the precipitation increase over Europe in winter and, consequently, the related potential risks.","2021-05","2023-09-26 16:12:34","2023-09-26 16:12:34","","","","5","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000648715100001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;13<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;13<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;67</p>","","","climate change; CMIP6; MODEL; IMPACT; OCEAN; SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; NORTH-ATLANTIC; RESOLUTION; CLIMATE-CHANGE PROJECTIONS; INTENSITY; ATMOSPHERIC RESPONSE; European precipitation; HIERARCHY; high-resolution climate modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It was proposed that ENSO-like sea surface temperature (SST) variations play a central role in the Pacific responses to the AMO forcing. However, observational analyses indicate that the AMO-related SST anomalies in the tropical Pacific are far weaker than those in the extratropical North Pacific. Here, we show that SST in the North Pacific is tied to the AMO forcing by convective heating associated with precipitation over the tropical Pacific, instead of by SST there, based on an ensemble of pacemaker experiments with North Atlantic SST restored to the observation in a coupled general circulation model. The AMO modulates precipitation over the equatorial and tropical southwestern Pacific through exciting an anomalous zonal circulation and an interhemispheric asymmetry of net moist static energy input into the atmosphere. The convective heating associated with the precipitation anomalies drives SST variations in the North Pacific through a teleconnection, but it remarkably weakens the ENSO-like SST anomalies through a thermocline damping effect. This study has implications that the IPO is a combined mode generated by both AMO forcing and local air-sea interactions, but the IPO-related global warming acceleration/slowdown is independent of the AMO.","2021-07","2023-09-26 16:12:34","2023-09-26 16:12:34","","5543-5553","","13","34","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000775651000022","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;61</p>","","","Climate change; MODEL; DYNAMICS; CIRCULATION; Climate models; TELECONNECTIONS; ENSO; FLUX; Air-sea interaction; Decadal variability; NORTH PACIFIC; PREDICTIONS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Assessing the potential distribution of tea will help decision makers to formulate appropriate adaptation measures to use the altered climatic resources and avoid the damage from climate hazards. The objective in this study is to model the current and future distribution of tea species based on the four SSPs scenarios using the MaxEnt model in China. For the modeling procedure, tea growth records in 410 sites and 9 climate variables were used in this paper. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the performance of the model. The AUC value was over 0.9 in this study, showing the excellent simulation result of the model. In relation to the current distribution, areas of 82.01 x 10(4) km(2) (8.51% of total land area in China), 115.97 x 10(4) km(2) (12.03% of total land area in China), and 67.14 x 10(4) km(2) (6.97% of total land area in China) were recognized as Marginal, Medium, and Optimal climate suitable habitats for tea over China. Compared to the current distribution, most of the Optimal suitability areas in southeast China would be lost in four scenarios. The area of Marginal and Medium suitable habitats would expand in SSP370 and SSP585, especially in 2041-2061 and 2081-2100. The suitable area of tea would expand northwards and westwards, suggesting that additional new suitable habitats could be created for tea production with the future climate change, especially in Shandong, Henan, Guizhou, and Yunnan Provinces. This research would provide vital scientific understanding for policy making on tea production, tea garden site chosen and adopyion of adaptation methods in the future.","2021-11","2023-09-26 16:12:34","2023-09-26 16:12:34","","","","11","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000724592600001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;10<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;10<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;85</p>","","","climate change; SYSTEM; China; IMPACTS; FUTURE; tea; TREE; MaxEnt; SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS; climate suitable habitats; MEDICINAL-PLANT; NICHE; POTENTIAL DISTRIBUTION; SRI-LANKA; SSPS; SUITABILITY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hydrogen, however, offers one potential solution to this dilemma given that is an abundant and energy dense fuel capable of not just meeting industrial energy requirements, but also providing long-duration energy storage. Despite the abundance and potential of hydrogen, isolating it and utilizing it for industrial decarbonization remains logistically challenging and is, in many cases, expensive. Industrial utilization of hydrogen is currently dominated by oil refining and chemical production with nearly all of the hydrogen used in these applications coming from fossil fuels. The generation of low-carbon or zero-carbon hydrogen for industrial applications requires new modes of hydrogen production that either intrinsically produce no carbon emissions or are combined with carbon capture technologies. This review takes a sociotechnical perspective to examine the full range of industries and industrial processes for which hydrogen can support decarbonization and the technical, economic, social and political factors that will impact hydrogen adoption.","2021-10","2023-09-26 16:12:34","2023-09-26 16:12:34","","","","","80","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000722432000008","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;98<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;98<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;685</p>","","","Climate change; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RENEWABLE ENERGY; Climate mitigation; Industrial decarbonization; AIR-POLLUTION; NATURAL-GAS; Anthropogenic emissions; BIOHYDROGEN PRODUCTION; FUEL-CELLS; HEALTH IMPACT ASSESSMENT; Hydrogen; LOW-CARBON PRODUCTION; MULTIGENERATION ENERGY SYSTEM; SUSTAINABLE ENERGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Ethiopia, the primary driver of low wheat productivity is attributed to climate change. Due to the sparsity of observation data, climate-related impact analysis is poorly understood, and the adaptation strategies studied so far have also been insufficient. This study adopted the most popular DSSAT CERES-Wheat model and the ensemble mean of four GCMs to examine the quantitative effects of adjusted sowing dates and varieties on wheat yield. The two new cultivars (Dandaa and Kakaba), with reference to an old cultivar (Digelu), were considered for the mid-century (2036-2065) and late-century (2066-2095) under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 climate scenarios. The results showed that the Dandaa cultivar demonstrates better adaptation potential at late sowing with a yield increase of about 140 kg/ha to 148 kg/ha for the mid- and late-century under RCP4.5. However, under RCP 8.5, Kakaba demonstrates higher adaptation potential with a yield gain for early sowing of up to 142 kg/ha and 170 kg/ha during the mid- and late-century, respectively. Late sowing of the Dandaa cultivar is recommended if GHG emissions are cut off at least to the average scenario, while the Kakaba cultivar is the best option when the emissions are high. The adaptation measures assessed in this study could help to enhance wheat production and adaptability of wheat to the future climate.","2022-01","2023-09-26 16:12:34","2023-09-26 16:12:34","","","","1","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000747765300001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;68</p>","","","climate change; TEMPERATURE; VARIABILITY; CHALLENGES; SIMULATION; IMPACTS; YIELD; AGRICULTURE; adaptation; Ethiopia; climate scenarios; OPTIONS; VARIETIES; RCPs; wheat; DSSAT","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Firstly, the model is validated against historic observations at 10 m, before being applied to the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5 that represent an average expected future and a worst-case scenario. Projected changes in the mean annual wind speed at 100 m, between the historic (1980-2004) and future (2020-2044) scenarios are found to vary locally between -5% and +20%, whereas for the Wind Energy Density (WED) this variation lies between -15% and +60%. Overall, robust and significant increases regarding the mean wind speeds were found mainly over the north and central-western Aegean region, the Island of Crete, as well over Greek mainland and the Ionian Sea. Both scenarios predicted higher statistically significant increases in the Weibull shape parameter values (of about 0.2) in the north-central Aegean, while the summer seasonal analysis, yielded significant decreases over the western Ionian Sea and south and south-western parts of Crete, which might be indicative of more gusty events. Finally, extreme wind speeds analysis indicated increases, which might affect wind turbines structural integrity. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we map our findings, delineating differences based on gender, age, and geography. Our results indicate that the media's focus on young female activists is warranted-at least in Europe and North America. We find that while activists share a commitment toward rapid and substantial reduction of greenhouse gases, their attitudes and actions taken to address climate change can significantly differ by demographic group.

To better understand this climate change and sustainable development goals (SDGs) funding dilemma, there needs to be greater clarity around four climate change investment and finance-related questions that are frequently absent or inadequately addressed in the academic and policy literature. Firstly, what are or should be the boundaries of climate change investment and finance when the problem of climate change becomes impossible to separate from biodiversity, land use management, and other dilemmas related to the broader SDGs? Secondly, how we should define and what constitutes ""adequate"" financial resources to address the climate change and SDGs dilemmas on the global level?

Finally, what role should the private sector and business actors play in terms of climate change investment and finance issues? In addition to achieving greater clarity around these four issue areas, I argue in this article that three questions are likely to shape the future success (or failure) of the global climate change investment and finance architecture.

We target the analysis to better characterize the quality of the RCMs by providing an evaluation of these RCM simulations over a number of classical climate variables and extreme and impact-oriented indices for the period 1981-2010. For the main variables, the model simulations generally agree with observations and reanalyses. However, several systematic biases are found as well, with shared responsibilities among RCMs and GCMs: Simulations are overall too cold, too wet, and too windy compared to available observations or reanalyses. Some simulations show strong systematic biases on temperature, others on precipitation or dynamical variables, but none of the models/simulations can be defined as the best or the worst on all criteria.

Statistical downscaling techniques are widely used to correct biases of GCM projections. The objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of nine statistical downscaling methods from three available statistical downscaling categories to simulate daily precipitation distribution, frequency, and temporal sequence at four Oklahoma weather stations representing arid to humid climate regions. The three downscaling categories included perfect prognosis (PP), model output statistics (MOS), and stochastic weather generator (SWG). To minimize the effect of GCM projection error on downscaling quality, the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Reanalysis 1 data at a 2.5 degrees grid spacing (treated as observed grid data) were downscaled to the four weather stations (representing arid, semi-arid, sub humid, and humid regions) using the nine downscaling methods. The station observations were divided into calibration and validation periods in a way that maximized the differences in annual precipitation means between the two periods for assessing the ability of each method in downscaling non-stationary climate changes. All methods were ranked with three metrics (Euclidean distance, sum of absolute relative error, and absolute error) for their ability in simulating precipitation amounts at daily, monthly, yearly, and annual maximum scales. After eliminating the poorest two performers in simulating precipitation mean, distribution, frequency, and temporal sequence, the top four remaining methods in ascending order were Distribution-based Bias Correction (DBC), Generator for Point Climate Change (GPCC), SYNthetic weather generaTOR (SYNTOR), and LOCal Intensity scaling (LOCI). DBC and LOCI are bias-correction methods, and GPCC and SYNTOR are generator-based methods. The differences in performances among the downscaling methods were smaller within each downscaling category than between the categories. The performance of each method varied with the climate conditions of each station. Overall results indicated that the SWG methods had certain advantages in simulating daily precipitation distribution, frequency, and temporal sequence for non-stationary climate changes.","2021","2023-09-26 16:12:34","2023-09-26 16:12:34","","771-784","","3","64","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000664471700002","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;41</p>","","","Climate change; RUNOFF; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SCENARIOS; GENERATION; IMPACT ASSESSMENT; Statistical downscaling; FORECASTS; Climate downscaling; CLIGEN; Downscaling method evaluation; GCM OUTPUT; SEASONAL PRECIPITATION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we focus on summer rainfall of eastern Africa (SREA), which is crucial to the Ethiopian Highlands and feeds the flow of the Blue Nile River. The SREA region is highly vulnerable to droughts, with El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) being a leading cause of interannual rainfall variability. Adequate understanding and accurate representation of climate features that influence regional variability is an important but often neglected issue when evaluating models. We perform a process-based evaluation of GCMs, focusing on the upper-troposphere tropical easterly jet (TEJ), which has been hypothesized to link ENSO to SREA. We find that most models have an ENSO-TEJ coupling similar to observed, but the models diverge in their representation of TEJ-SREA coupling. Differences in the latter explain the majority (80%) of variability in ENSO teleconnection simulation across the models. This is higher than the variance explained by rainfall coupling with the Somali jet (44%) and African easterly jet (55%). However, our diagnostics of the leading hypothesized mechanism in the models-variability in divergence in the TEJ exit region-are not consistent across models and suggest that a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of TEJ-precipitation coupling should be a priority for studies of climate variability and change in the region.","2021-01","2023-09-26 16:12:33","2023-09-26 16:12:33","","293-312","","1","34","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000615484800018","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;62</p>","","","Climate change; Climate variability; Africa; ENSO; Model evaluation/performance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A methodological framework applicable to city-level study is proposed and applied in Tianjin to investigate the impacts of climate change on monthly electricity consumption. By combining the empirical results with an ensemble of climate predictions under three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), the study simulates the changes in monthly electricity demand caused by climate change in Tianjin by the end-of-century.

However, there are important differences between carbon dioxide (CO2), which is a stock pollutant, and methane (CH4), which is predominantly a flow pollutant. These dynamics mean that conventional reporting of aggregated CO2-equivalent emission rates is highly ambiguous and does not straightforwardly reflect historical or anticipated contributions to global temperature change. As a result, the roles and responsibilities of different sectors emitting different gases are similarly obscured by the common means of communicating emission reduction scenarios using CO2-equivalence. We argue for a shift in how we report agricultural greenhouse gas emissions and think about their mitigation to better reflect the distinct roles of different greenhouse gases. Policy-makers, stakeholders, and society at large should also be reminded that the role of agriculture in climate mitigation is a much broader topic than climate science alone can inform, including considerations of economic and technical feasibility, preferences for food supply and land-use, and notions of fairness and justice. A more nuanced perspective on the impacts of different emissions could aid these conversations.","2021-02-03","2023-09-26 16:12:33","2023-09-26 16:12:33","","","","","4","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000618532100001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;91<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;91<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;48</p>","","","climate change; climate policy; agriculture; CO2; methane; nitrous oxide","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, its distribution range has changed significantly in recent years due to climate change as well as human factors. Without extensive knowledge of the changing trends in suitable sugarcane planting areas, efforts to improve its productivity in Guangxi may be insufficient. In this study, the interdecadal change in sugarcane distribution in Guangxi in response to climate change from 1960 to 2019 was estimated using the MaxEnt model and the landscape pattern of land use in the suitable sugarcane area was analyzed. In addition, we discuss the effects of global warming on sugarcane production in the sustainable development of the sugar industry in Guangxi. Our results indicate: (1) from 1960 to 2019, approximately 65% of Guangxi Province could grow sugarcane. Chongzuo City, Nanning City and Parts of Baise City, are highly suitable areas, and unsuitable areas are mainly concentrated in the north. In general, sugarcane climate suitability extended further in low-altitude areas, and then extended to high-altitude areas. However, from the 2000s to the 2010s, climate suitability showed a decreasing trend, decreasing from 16.036 x 10(6) ha to 15.4985 x 10(6) ha (2) The order of land use area in the suitable sugarcane climate range was as follows: woodland > cropland > grassland > construction land > water. With the increase in climate suitability, the distribution of cultivated land expanded. From 1980 to 2005, cropland in suitable areas showed a fragmentation trend. By 2010, the cropland patches disappeared after fragmentation. (3) Due to landscape constraints, infertile soil, and labor costs, the sugar industry faces various challenges. The evaluation of climate suitability could provide a theoretical reference for a planting layout of sugarcane, and landscape pattern analysis of suitable sugarcane climate areas is conducive to the integration of small pieces of land into large ones, making mechanization possible. Overall, strict layout and management measures are required in sugarcane planting areas.","2021-11","2023-09-26 16:12:33","2023-09-26 16:12:33","","","","","131","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000704535200003","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;18<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;19<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;70</p>","","","Climate change; IMPACTS; PRODUCTIVITY; MaxEnt model; PREDICTION; SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS; Climate suitability; YIELDS; EXPANSION; ART; MAIZE; Landscape pattern; REQUIREMENTS; Sugarcane","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Drawing on a survey of coffee farmers in Honduras, this study explores the impact of climate change risk perception (CCRP) on adaptation behavior of coffee farmers and explores the mediating role of climate-related attitudinal factors and the moderating role of self-efficacy in the relationship between climate change risk perception and adaptation behavior. Data are analyzed in the partial least square structural equation model (PLS-SEM) (v 3.3.3). The findings of this study supported the hypothesized relationship between CCRP and adaptation behavior, mediated by climate-related attitudinal factors, such that, concern for climate change, skepticism, and feeling of powerlessness significantly mediate the underlying relationship between CCRP and adaptation behavior. Furthermore, the study found that self-efficacy significantly moderates the relationship between CCRP and adaptation behavior such that the relationship is more pronounced at high levels of self-efficacy and vice versa. In addition, the study also found significant interaction effect of self-efficacy in the indirect relationship between CCRP and adaptation behavior, mediated by attitudes towards climate change.

As greenhouse-gas emissions in the atmosphere are increasing, the temperature is also rising due to the greenhouse effect. The average global temperature is increasing continuously and is predicted to rise by 2 degrees C until 2100, which would cause substantial economic losses at the global level. The concentration of CO2, which accounts for a major proportion of greenhouse gases, is increasing at an alarming rate, and has led to higher growth and plant productivity due to increased photosynthesis, but increased temperature offsets this effect as it leads to increased crop respiration rate and evapotranspiration, higher pest infestation, a shift in weed flora, and reduced crop duration. Climate change also affects the microbial population and their enzymatic activities in soil. This paper reviews the information collected through the literature regarding the issue of climate change, its possible causes, its projection in the near future, its impact on the agriculture sector as an influence on physiological and metabolic activities of plants, and its potential and reported implications for growth and plant productivity, pest infestation, and mitigation strategies and their economic impact.","2021-02","2023-09-26 16:12:33","2023-09-26 16:12:33","","","","3","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000615624700001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;203<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;205<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;148</p>","","","climate change; TEMPERATURE; ECONOMIC-IMPACT; CHANGE ADAPTATION; economics; climate-smart agriculture; CONSERVATION AGRICULTURE; PROJECTED CHANGES; CROP-YIELD; DEVELOPING-WORLD; diseases; GREENHOUSE GASES; LEAF COLOR CHART; NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT; pest; weeds","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Climate change has a considerable influence on the success of agricultural production in the rural communities of Zimbabwe. Hence, it becomes fundamental to assess the community-based methods of climate governance. Qualitative multiple case study exploratory designs were employed with data collected through individual interviews with smallholder farmers, and thematic content analysis was used to analyse data. This study found that enhancing and embracing IKS is of paramount importance for inclusion in local-level strategies in the development process with special reference to climate governance in water and land resource management, particularly in under-resourced communities. It also established that the use of IKS enhances communities' adaptive capacity and it should not be conducted at the expense of scientific methods but rather should be employed in order to complement the existing scientific global knowledge systems.","2021-08","2023-09-26 16:12:33","2023-09-26 16:12:33","","2045-2054","","5","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000634709600001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;28</p>","","","climate change; RISK; CHANGE ADAPTATION; indigenous knowledge systems; climate governance; TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE; CULTURE; FORECASTS; rural Zimbabwe","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Indeed, using a new analysis on spatial modeling, this work demonstrates the direct and indirect effects of precipitation as well as temperature on the climate migration of a governorate and those of neighboring governorates through the production of irrigated and non-irrigated plants. In addition, spatial modeling shows that the impact of climate change on migration through cereal and olive production differs from that of irrigated plants, thus demonstrating the importance of taking explicit account of the spatial effects between governorates. The decline in a farmer's income in (a) governorate is a factor in rural exodus and migration to other governorates with water and a more favorable climate. This cause-and-effect phenomenon is known as negative externalities because some regions are forced to suffer from the consequences of the arrival of a new population. The originality of this method is that it allows the impact of spatial externalities to be taken into account in an effective way.

In this study, we have generated ranked temperature and rainfall data iteratively from 1951 to 2020 and assessed if the trend of occurrences of these extremes (high & low) in New Zealand is changing. To do this, we calculated an extremeness ratio, which is derived by normalising the observed extremes with an expected probability of an extreme based on no long-term warming. We found that, in the last decade, on average, high monthly mean temperature extremes in New Zealand are increasing 4-5 times larger than expected in a climate with no long term warming. We also examined New Zealand's homogenised seven-station temperature series and found a similar trend for mean temperature extremes. In addition, we calculated the mean temperature extremes taking the climate warming trend (similar to 1 degrees C per century) into account and found that the rate of increase in extremes is faster than the rate of increase in mean temperature. We also find a positive trend in both high and low rainfall extremes with the low rainfall trend most prominent in eastern New Zealand.","2021","2023-09-26 16:12:32","2023-09-26 16:12:32","","18-29","","1","41","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000984038400002","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;17</p>","","","climate change; Climate extremes; rainfall extremes; rankings; temperature extremes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we aim to investigate potential future change in circulation over Europe by using the EURO-CORDEX regional climate projections at 0.11 degrees grid mesh. In particular, we analyze future change in 500-hPa geopotential height (Gph), 500-hPa wind speed and mean sea level pressure (MSLP) addressing different warming levels of 1 degrees C, 2 degrees C and 3 degrees C, respectively. Simple scaling with the global mean temperature change is applied to the regional climate projections for monthly mean 500-hPa Gph and 500-hPa wind speed. Results from the ensemble mean of individual models show a robust increase in 500-hPa Gph and MSLP in winter over Mediterranean and Central Europe, indicating an intensification of anticyclonic circulation. This circulation change emerges robustly in most simulations within the coming decade. There are also enhanced westerlies which transport warm and moist air to the Mediterranean and Central Europe in winter and spring. It is also clear that, models showing different responses to circulation depend very much on the global climate model ensemble member in which they are nested. For all seasons, particularly autumn, the ensemble mean is much more correlated with the end of the century than most of the individual models. In general, the emergence of a scaled pattern appears rather quickly.","2022-09","2023-09-26 16:12:32","2023-09-26 16:12:32","","1799-1814","","5-6","59","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000722493100002","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;48</p>","","","VARIABILITY; Climate change; SIMULATIONS; EURO-CORDEX; Regional climate modeling; PATTERNS; Atmospheric circulation; CLIMATE-CHANGE PROJECTIONS; CHANGE SIGNALS; CMIP5 MODELS; LAPSE-RATE; UNCERTAINTIES","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, this uniformity conflicts with the notion that humidity controls tropical stability (e.g., the ""furnace"" and ""radiator fins"" of Pierrehumbert (1995, )). Here, we use a column model to explore the dependence of longwave clear-sky feedback on both surface temperature and relative humidity. We find that a strong humidity dependence in the feedback emerges above 275 K, which stems from the closing of the H2O window, and that the furnace and radiator fins are consequences of this dependence. We then clarify that radiator fins are better characterized by tropical variations in clear-sky feedback than OLR. Finally, we construct a simple model for estimating the all-sky feedback and find that although clouds lower the magnitude of longwave feedback, the humidity-dependence persists.","2021-09-28","2023-09-26 16:12:32","2023-09-26 16:12:32","","","","18","48","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000703685100075","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;7<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;7<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;40</p>","","","climate change; RADIATION; climate feedback; CLIMATE FEEDBACK; radiator fins; tropics; water vapor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Gymnosperm species dominate and co-dominate more than half of China's forest area, but many of them are threatened and vulnerable to climate changes. This study mapped the geographical distributions of 209 gymnosperm species in China, modeled the niches of 124 gymnosperm species with adequate records of field occurrences using MaxEnt, and predicted their range changes under two dispersal scenarios (no dispersal and unlimited dispersal) and three emission scenarios (Representative concentration pathway [RCP] 2.6, RCP 6.0, RCP 8.5). To inform gymnosperm conservation facing climate change, we proposed a multi-criteria framework to identify conservation priority areas by integrating information on species diversity patterns and potential climate refugia, and detected gymnosperm conservation gaps with reference to the existing conservation networks. Our results indicated that the centers of species richness, threatened species, and endemism of gymnosperms in China were highly consistent in space and were concentrated in the subtropical mountains. By the 2070s, 64 (RCP 2.6)-88 (RCP 8.5) species would lose more than 10% of their currently suitable climatic niche, and 19 (RCP 2.6)-45 (RCP 8.5) species would lose more than 30%. Cathaya argyrophylla (endangered, EN), Pinus bungeana (EN), Pinus koraiensis (vulnerable, VU) and Torreya fargesii (VU) would be most vulnerable to the projected climate changes. Seven high conservation priority regions were identified, and a substantial proportion of the regions were found lack of adequate protection. The primary recommended measures included increasing the size of protected areas to cover more high priority regions and establishing populations in new sites as required ex-situ conservation efforts.","2021-01","2023-09-26 16:12:32","2023-09-26 16:12:32","","","","","253","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000609483300012","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;13<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;16<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;77</p>","","","Climate change; BIODIVERSITY; DIVERSITY; MODELS; CHANGE IMPACTS; PATTERNS; DISTRIBUTIONS; MaxEnt; CHANGE VELOCITY; Climate velocity; Conservation gaps; Hotspots; HOTSPOTS; PLANT; RARE; Refugia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The concept of sustainability is central to these efforts, as climate adaptation discussions are often framed within the context of economic resilience, environmental protection, and social vulnerability. For urban centers, the climate change issue presents unique challenges for each of these dimensions; however, its potential impacts on marginalized populations are extensive. This study draws from the 'just sustainabilities' (Agyeman, Bullard, and Evans 2003) framework and applies the concepts of distributive and procedural justice to examine whether, and to what extent, U.S. cities prioritize social equity concerns in adaptation plans. We perform a qualitative analysis of climate adaptation plans prepared by 22 of the 100 largest U.S. cities.

Northern peatlands store a considerable amount of C, but their response to climate change remains highly uncertain. In order to explore the feedback of a peatland in the Great Hing'an Mountains to future climate change, we simulated the response of the overall net ecosystem exchange (NEE), ecosystem respiration (ER), and gross primary production (GPP) during 2020-2100 under three representative concentration pathways (RCP2.6, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5). Under the RCP2.6 and RCP6.0 scenarios, the carbon sink will increase slightly until 2100. Under the RCP8.5 scenario, the carbon sink will follow a trend of gradual decrease after 2053. These results show that when meteorological factors, especially temperature, reach a certain degree, the carbon source/sink of the peatland ecosystem will be converted. In general, although the peatland will remain a carbon sink until the end of the 21st century, carbon sinks will decrease under the influence of climate change. Our results indicate that in the case of future climate warming, with the growing seasons experiencing overall dryer and warmer environments and changes in vegetation communities, peatland NEE, ER, and GPP will increase and lead to the increase in ecosystem carbon accumulation.","2022-01","2023-09-26 16:12:32","2023-09-26 16:12:32","","","","1","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000747208800001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;87</p>","","","climate change; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RESPONSES; EMISSIONS; NITROGEN; SOIL ORGANIC-CARBON; ARCTIC TUNDRA; PLANT; carbon exchange; CO2 FLUXES; CoupModel; future climate scenario; HEATH ECOSYSTEM; NORTHEAST CHINA; peatland","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we review the literature that spanned the years 1991-2022 on fifteen large carnivore species and their response to climate change via the proxies of (1) habitat alterations; (2) diet profile changes; and (3) behavioural changes. The literature re-view highlighted that 15 large carnivore species had been taken into account by 164 studies (87 on habitat, 59 on diet, 18 on behaviour) on potential climate change effects in five continents. Eighty-seven studies featured projected or current changes in suitable habitat due to climate change, 59 studies featured projected or current changes in preferred diet dueto climate change, and 18 studies covered proposed or current behaviour changes in response to climate change. Of the 87 suitable habitat studies, 66 (78 %) were categorized as negative, i.e., when a potential reduction in resources has been projected. Of the 59 preferred diet studies, 39 (66 %) were categorized as negative. Des -pite the evidence that information on how large carnivore habitats, diets, and behaviours might be affected by climate change are still scarce for several species and/or geographical areas, most of the available predictions point to an unfortunate truth. Species with habitats susceptible to con-siderable alterations will probably experience a severe local decline in the next few decades. Loss of suitable habitats and decreased food availability, which has been forecasted for most large car-nivores, might also induce these species to shift their home ranges in search of alternative food sources. These may include areas where they are more likely to experience more conflict with hu-mans. Large carnivores require long-ter m conservation, management strategies, and more research to develop a deeper understanding of climate change's impacts and establish pre-emptive measures ensuring population viability in the following decades.","2022","2023-09-26 16:12:32","2023-09-26 16:12:32","","1-8","","2","33","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000958404600001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;114</p>","","","climate change; LAND-USE; global warming; POLAR BEARS; CONSERVATION; BLACK BEAR POPULATION; diet changes; FOOD-HABITS; GIANT PANDA; habitat changes; large carnivores; PANTHERA-LEO; predators; QINLING MOUNTAINS; SNOW LEOPARDS; URSUS-ARCTOS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An evaluation methodology is developed to evaluate spatiotemporal patterns of precipitation, near-surface temperature, and 850-hPa wind. Mean annual cycles of temperature and rainfall are assessed separately over Indochina, the Maritime Continent, and the Philippines; and the summer and winter seasons are selected for studying spatial patterns. Within these distinctions, statistics comparing the models to reference data are calculated. The patterns' shape and phase are notably studied, and wind direction differences are assessed specifically over the most major wind flows. We present a scoring procedure allowing us to give each model a unique score reporting on the diverse evaluation aspects, hence establishing a ranking. The process rests on a scoring function growing exponentially with the performance: it favours the models combining good performances according to the largest number of criteria. The assessment highlights EC-Earth3 and EC-Earth3-Veg, which conduct excellent simulations of the regional patterns of rainfall and wind. Their temperature outputs are also reliable, but CNRM-CM6 ranks first for this variable, while finishing third globally. Local differences are discussed: we emphasize, among other things, the diverse impact of topography on temperature and rainfall, or the frequent deviation of winter winds circulating from the South China Sea to the Java Sea. In addition, a similarity study reveals major difficulties for simulating near-equatorial annual cycles of temperature and precipitation whereas the summer monsoon spatial rainfall patterns bring out the largest discrepancies. In any event, the top models pointed out by our ranking constitute a high-performance subset that further climate modelling experiments in SEA can rely on.","2022-01","2023-09-26 16:12:32","2023-09-26 16:12:32","","97-117","","1","42","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000661814800001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;13<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;13<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;40</p>","","","climate change; RAINFALL; CMIP6; PRECIPITATION; PERFORMANCE; PREDICTABILITY; MONSOON; Southeast Asia; model ranking; regional climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We draw upon securitization theory to examine how security narratives affect climate change adaptation. Using primary and secondary data, we find that although securitization arguments are easily identified in climate change policies and action plans in Nigeria, the implications of securitization for adaptation policy and practice are harder to discern. We find that adaptation is not as urgent a policy as would be expected from the logic of securitization. The transformation of security framing into urgent adaptation actions appears difficult because there are no urgent adaptation measures.

Recently, however, a movement with people avoiding and problematizing flying has emerged in Sweden and spread internationally. This paper explores how the rising problematization of flying changes the meanings of holiday air travel in a carbon-constrained world. Using travel magazines and digital media sources, we trace changing discourses (overarching ideas and traditions shaping social practices) of holiday air travel in Sweden from 1950-2019. The paper identifies the emergence of a new discourse (Staying on the ground) and shows how it works through moralization (flying is ethically wrong) and persuasion (emphasizing alternatives) to challenge dominant meanings of holiday air travel as desirable and necessary. While Staying on the ground is far from a dominant discourse, there are signs that it has begun to destabilize contemporary cultures of aeromobility. The Staying on the ground discourse exemplifies how meanings attached to ingrained high-carbon practices, and the policies that sustain them, are currently being contested and rearticulated. Acknowledging that low-carbon transformations are fundamentally forms of social and cultural change, the paper illustrates why practices of carbon lock-in are so entrenched, but also how they might be resisted and open up for change.","2023-03-04","2023-09-26 16:12:32","2023-09-26 16:12:32","","688-705","","3","31","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000721132200001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;90</p>","","","Climate change; CLIMATE; social change; AVIATION; aviation; cultural change; social norms; sustainable tourism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we combine single-model large ensemble simulations with phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) to diagnose the mechanisms for these differences. The sensitivity of precipitation to local SST anomalies increases consistently across CMIP-class models, tending to amplify extreme El Nino occurrence; however, changes to the magnitude of ENSO-related SST variability can drastically influence the results, indicating that understanding changes to SST variability remains imperative. Future El Nino rainfall intensifies most in models with 1) larger historical cold SST biases in the central equatorial Pacific, which inhibit future increases in local convective cloud shading, enabling more local warming; and 2) smaller historical warm SST biases in the far eastern equatorial Pacific, which enhance future reductions in stratus cloud, enabling more local warming.

Key questions that the authors investigate include: how will the renewable energy transition reshape the global balance of power? How will political-economic interdependencies and geopolitical alignments shift? Will contemporary petro-states adapt or collapse? And what new patterns of peace and conflict may emerge in a decarbonized world order? The authors provide different perspectives on the likely speed of the energy transition and its geopolitical implications. However, they occlude deeper questions about the depth of the transformations needed to prevent climate catastrophe-particularly in the nature of capitalism and military power-and the potential for more radical perspectives on energy futures. In contrast, I will argue that we should advance a critical research agenda on the global energy transition that accounts for the possibility of more far-reaching transformations in the political-economic, military, and ideological bases of world politics and highlights diverse movements fighting for their realization. These possible transformations include (1) transitions to post-growth political economies; (2) a radical shrinkage of emissions-intensive military-industrial complexes; and (3) decolonizing ideologies of ""progress."" If struggles for alternative energy futures beyond the hegemony of economic growth and Western-style modernization are at the forefront of radical politics today, then these struggles deserve greater attention from critical IR scholars.","2021-08","2023-09-26 16:12:31","2023-09-26 16:12:31","","89-98","","3","46","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000688760800001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;36</p>","","","climate change; climate justice; renewable energy; energy transition; geopolitics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Climate change is a global phenomenon and poses diverse implications in form and type for different ecologies. Human activities are greatly disturbing the nature through using the land for different types of anthropogenic activities like cultural, financial matters, environmental aspects. land policy and land development plans. The present study aims to analyze the climatic variation and assess the land use change of district Bahawalpur having total area of 24,830 km(2). Climatic data (minimum temperature, maximum temperature and rainfall) were collected for a period of 30 years (1989-2018). Monthly mean minimum and maximum temperature, annual rainfall, Diurnal Temperature Range (DTR) and their anomalies were calculated using secondary data for the study area. Land use data were collected in the form of Landsat satellite images of last 30 years (1990-2019) with 10 yeas interval from different online sources. Landsat ETM and ETM + satellite imagery were processed in ArcGIS software. Results showed that there is a great variation in maximum temperature anomaly during the entire study period. Minimum temperature anomaly shows positive and negative trend during the entire study period from 1989 to 2019. There is a great variation in DTR anomaly during the study period. 10-years moving average of DTR anomaly remained positive during most of the time. There is variation in annual rainfall anomaly, with both positive and negative values. As in the whole time span of 30 years, built-up land increased from 2.54% (631 Km(2)) in 1990 to 4.66% (1,157 Km(2)) at the end of 2019. Agricultural land use also increased from 3,439 Km(2) (13.85%) to 5,168 Km(2) (20.81%). Forest land use decreased from the 1,321 Km2 (5.32%) to 775 Km(2) (3.12%) at end of 2019. Water occupied land with the high fluctuation was 109 Km(2) (0.44%) in 1990 and in 2019 it recorded 148 Km(2) (0.60%). The main land use class desert land also decreased from an area of 19,330 Km(2) (77.85%) to 17,582 Km(2) (70.81%). Correlation of land use change classes in last 30 years showed relationship intensity between different land use changes. Agricultural land and built up land have strong relationship with the value of 0.98. Desert land and agricultural land have strongly negative relationship with the value of -0.94. This study found how rapidly changes occurred in the land use with rate of land use change is a mile stone for the planners, researchers and scholars for the better understanding towards land use change in district Bahawalpur.","2021","2023-09-26 16:12:31","2023-09-26 16:12:31","","4901-4910","","5","30","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000658173700023","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;20</p>","","","Climate change; Land cover change; Agricultural land; Desertification; Spatio-temporal change","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The project involved extensive investments in watershed development, agro-forestry and crop varietal enhancement with the goal of creating a model from which climate-resilient practices could diffuse outwards. We analyse the politics behind this project and highlight its attempt to build resilience through field-level infrastructures and practices. While some project interventions provided generalised benefits, the failure to explicitly address local social structures and power relations created significant unevenness and left resources open to capture by elites. On this basis, we question the narrowness of resilience perspectives used to guide to adaptation planning. For many smallholders, a meaningful notion of 'resilience' would entail buffering exposure not just to climatic stresses but also to local power relations and market forces, yet these dynamics were silenced in official project discourse.","2021-11","2023-09-26 16:12:31","2023-09-26 16:12:31","","431-440","","","126","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000710900900003","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;25<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;26<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;71</p>","","","Climate change; POVERTY; Climate-smart agriculture; FARMERS; India; Resilience; ADAPTATION STRATEGIES; Political ecology; SMART AGRICULTURE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These 'convection-permitting' models (CPMs), commonly used for weather forecasting, better represent land-surface characteristics and small-scale processes in the atmosphere such as convection. They provide a step change in our understanding of future changes at local scales and for extreme weather events. For short-duration precipitation extremes, this includes capturing local storm feedbacks, which may modify future increases. Despite the major advance CPMs offer, there are still key challenges and outstanding science issues. Heavy rainfall tends to be too intense; there are challenges in representing land-surface processes; sub-kilometre scale processes still need to be parametrized, with existing parametrization schemes often requiring development for use in CPMs; CPMs rely on the quality of lateral boundary forcing and typically do not include ocean-coupling; large CPM ensembles that comprehensively sample future uncertainties are costly. Significant progress is expected over the next few years: scale-aware schemes may improve the representation of unresolved convective updrafts; work is underway to improve the modelling of complex land-surface fluxes; CPM ensemble experiments are underway and methods to synthesize this information with larger coarser-resolution model ensembles will lead to local-scale predictions with more comprehensive uncertainty context for user application. Large-domain (continental or tropics-wide) CPM climate simulations, potentially with additional earth-system processes such as ocean and wave coupling and terrestrial hydrology, are an exciting prospect, allowing not just improved representation of local processes but also of remote teleconnections.

The various impacts of climate change pose significant risks to Pacific Island communities and people's livelihoods. A community consists of different groups of people and requires contributions from all members to build community resilience to the impacts of climate change. The Indigenous Fijian (iTaukei) women have skills, knowledge, and unique local and traditional experience that can increase the resilience of the community, however, their voice is not often heard in a patriarchal community. An understanding of gender roles in a community is essential for adaptation to climate change. Fijian communities exhibit elaborate social support system and traditional practices that demonstrate high level of dynamism and institutional support in the community's response to risks. Using semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and participant observations, the study investigated the enabling and inhibiting factors that affect the ability of iTaukei women to contribute to building community resilience. The findings from the study identified that the village women contribute significantly to three key areas of community resilience, particularly social resilience, economic resilience and ecological resilience. The findings also indicated that women face barriers that prevent them from contributing to decision-making on issues related to climate change resilience in the community. The study recommends interventions that are culturally accepted and that also support the role of women in decision-making, while promoting their participation in various climate change forums in the community.","2022-01","2023-09-26 16:12:31","2023-09-26 16:12:31","","","","","90","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000724920800002","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;15<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;15<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;62</p>","","","Climate change; Climate resilience; CHANGE ADAPTATION; GENDER; Barriers; DISASTER RISK REDUCTION; ADAPTIVE CAPACITY; ISLAND; Gender; Women's role","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Inferences about conditions at or below 2 degrees C are usually made based on transient climate projections. To better understand climate change impacts on natural and human systems under the Paris Agreement, we must understand how a stable climate may differ from transient conditions at the same warming level. Here we examine differences between transient and quasi-equilibrium climates using a statistical framework applied to greenhouse gas-only model simulations. This allows us to infer climate change patterns at 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C global warming in both transient and quasi-equilibrium climate states. We find substantial local differences between seasonal-average temperatures dependent on the rate of global warming, with mid-latitude land regions in boreal summer considerably warmer in a transient climate than a quasi-equilibrium state at both 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C global warming. In a rapidly warming world, such locations may experience a temporary emergence of a local climate change signal that weakens if the global climate stabilizes and the Paris Agreement goals are met. Our research demonstrates that the rate of global warming must be considered in regional projections.","2021-11","2023-09-26 16:12:31","2023-09-26 16:12:31","","","","11","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000722483400001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;63</p>","","","climate change; TEMPERATURE; CMIP6; SIMULATIONS; IMPACTS; SEA-ICE; MECHANISMS; TIME; 1.5 DEGREES-C; EMERGENCE; EXPERIMENTAL-DESIGN; MODEL INTERCOMPARISON PROJECT; Paris agreement; rapid warming; stabilized climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study assessed the actual changes in deforestation levels and improved livelihoods caused by the adoption of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices. Data were collected through semi-structured household questionnaires, focus group discussions, key informants, GIS tools, and observations. Quantitative data were analyzed using Arc GIS 10.3 software, SPSS version 16.0, and Excel Spreadsheet, while qualitative data were analyzed through content analysis techniques. The findings show that farmers' livelihoods have improved and also deforestation levels decreased as a result of increased adoption of CSA during the past 30 years. Deforestation levels have been reduced from 64.6 ha per year during 1985-1995 to 11.8 ha per year during 1995-2005 and to 10.4 ha per year during 2005-2017. Further findings showed that the agricultural area had been decreased from 4,534 ha in 1995 to 4,039 ha in 2017, which is evidence that after the scale-up of CSA from the year 1992, agricultural practices were not contributing much to deforestation, while increased crop production and income were observed, which in turn supported farmers in enhancing food security, purchasing production tools, livestock, and payment for medical services, school fees, and construction of modern houses. We found that adoption of CSA systems such as agroforestry (i.e., agrisilviculture) is very crucial for improving farmer's livelihoods and reducing deforestation. Therefore, farmers need close mentoring on climate-resilient agroforestry systems, such as agrisilviculture.</p>","2021-08-26","2023-09-26 16:12:31","2023-09-26 16:12:31","","","","","5","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000697841400001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;52</p>","","","ADAPTATION; climate change; Tanzania; CHALLENGES; climate-smart agriculture; livelihood; forest management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An increasing frequency and intensity of the compound climate extremes has been observed and projected under climate change, yet partitioning the total impacts to individual ones on crop yield has not been well assessed. In this study, we assessed the compound and separate effects of drought and high temperature on maize yield under 9 climate-year types (CYTs) with different combinations of precipitation and temperature in Northeast China (NEC). The well-validated Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) model was used to simulate the maize yield, driven by historical (1981-2017) and future climate data (2021-2060). The results show that CYTs of warm (warm-dry, warm-wet, warm) are prominent in the future under both Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. However, CYT of warm-wet increased mostly (11.5%) under RCP8.5, while warm-dry increased most (12.3%) under RCP4.5. The magnitude of maize yield loss caused by the compound of high temperature and drought (18.75%) is higher than the individual ones (drought 17.32% and high temperature 1.27%). There are variations in the effects of stresses on maize yield among CYTs and the yield reductions by the compound effects of drought and high temperature were warm-dry > warm > rainless > warm-wet > normal > cold-dry > cold > rainy > cold-wet. In addition, the yield loss was negatively correlated with T-max and VPDmax but positively correlated with Prec. These findings imply the importance of fully considering the selection of heat and drought-resistant varieties and implementing supplementary irrigation for future climate mitigation strategies during maize production in NEC.","2022-03-15","2023-09-26 16:12:31","2023-09-26 16:12:31","","","","","812","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000740223300006","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;33<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;34<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;37</p>","","","Climate change; PRECIPITATION; CLIMATE; SYSTEMS; APSIM; Climate year types; Compound extremes; Yield","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Symptoms of misuse have included the treatment of an unrealistic, extreme scenario as the world's most likely future in the absence of climate policy and the illogical comparison of climate projections across inconsistent global development trajectories. Reasons why such misuse arose include (a) competing demands for scenarios from users in diverse academic disciplines that ultimately conflated exploratory and policy relevant pathways, (b) the evolving role of the IPCC - which extended its mandate in a way that creates an inter-relationship between literature assessment and literature coordination, (c) unforeseen consequences of employing a temporary approach to scenario development, (d) maintaining research practices that normalize careless use of scenarios, and (e) the inherent complexity and technicality of scenarios in model-based research and in support of policy. Consequently, much of the climate research community is presently off-track from scientific coherence and policy-relevance. Attempts to address scenario misuse within the community have thus far not worked. The result has been the widespread production of myopic or misleading perspectives on future climate change and climate policy. Until reform is implemented, we can expect the production of such perspectives to continue, threatening the overall credibility of the IPCC and associated climate research. However, because many aspects of climate change discourse are contingent on scenarios, there is considerable momentum that will make such a course correction difficult and contested even as efforts to improve scenarios have informed research that will be included in the IPCC 6th Assessment.","2021-02","2023-09-26 16:12:31","2023-09-26 16:12:31","","","","","72","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000624446600005","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;23<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;23<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;78</p>","","","Climate change; SCIENCE; EMISSIONS; IPCC; US; INTEGRATED ASSESSMENT MODELS; RCPs; Climate scenarios; Energy scenarios; SSPs; STABILIZATION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Three decadal climate variability (DCV) phenomena - the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), the tropical Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST) gradient variability (TAG), and the West Pacific Warm Pool (WPWP) variability - substantially influence hydro-meteorology and, consequently, spring and winter wheat yields in the MRB as indicated by data from 1961 to 2010. We applied the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to simulate DCV impacts on wheat yields in response to realistic values of the DCV indices in approximately 13,500 hydrologic unit areas covering the MRB. SWAT, driven by scenarios of past hydro-meteorological anomalies associated with positive and negative phases of the PDO and TAG, indicated major impacts on wheat yields, as much as +/- 40% of the average in many locations, with smaller impacts of the WPWP variability. SWAT showed much larger wheat yield increases when the positive phase of the PDO and the negative phase of the TAG are superposed, and an equivalent decrease in yields when opposite phases of the two DCV phenomena are superposed. Thus, combined effects of DCV phenomena on wheat yields in the MRB can be dramatic with important consequences for food production and security. The usefulness of this inter-disciplinary study to farmers and other stakeholders for adapting MRB agriculture to DCV, and the applicability of the methodology to other agricultural regions are described. The results' implications for detection and attribution of climatic change impacts are also described.","2021-10","2023-09-26 16:12:31","2023-09-26 16:12:31","","","","3-4","168","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000713121600001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;33</p>","","","PRECIPITATION; NORTH-AMERICA; FREQUENCY; SURFACE-TEMPERATURE; REANALYSIS; Food security; PACIFIC; DATASET; Adaptation to climate variability and change; Climate variability impacts; Crop modeling; Decadal climate variability; MODULATION; NCEP-NCAR; Near-term climate change impacts","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our results show that runoff in the Upstream Yangtze River decreases significantly with a rate of -7.6 km(3) per ten years in general. The most significant declines in runoff are observed in the mainstream, Minjiang River, Tuojiang River, and Jialing River, while slight increase in runoff is found in the source area of the Yangtze River. Furthermore, the effects on runoff change from climate change and human activities are evaluated using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and modified Fixing-Changing (MFC) method at multiple scales. Our results suggest that the main contributions to runoff change are from climate change variabilities (70%), land use/cover change (LUCC, 10%), and other human influence (20%).
